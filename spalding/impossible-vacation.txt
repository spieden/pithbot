[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.680]   Thanks for coming out.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:58.400]   I'm going to do something that's rare and unusual for me, and that's read from the book, rather than talk it.
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.920]   The book was 1,900 pages. You may know the story of it.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:10.960]   I worked on it for six years, and I refer to it as "auto-fiction," which is a Jersey Kaczynski term.
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:21.200]   The book is extremely autobiographic, but I have also taken liberty of changing my name from Spalding Gray to Brewster North,
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:33.600]   named after the railroad station, which was the last stop where I was writing the book in upstate, above Westchester, Brewster North.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:43.200]   The idea of the way that I was working on this book was a kind of free associative writing, not unlike psychoanalysis,
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   in the sense that I was writing everything that was on my mind, revolving around what I would say was the seduction
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:09.200]   that my mother and I perpetrated, this closeness that was with my mother, and her eventual suicide, which was just this July, now, 1967.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:23.200]   Lots of stuff was just pouring out, and I was hoping to edit it down from that, so we did edit it, some of us, from 1,900 pages to, I think, 228.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   There's another book on my desk that continues, where Brewster North reaches Bali, but I'm not ready to write it.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   I found writing to be one of the most isolating and disturbing and lonely, horrible experiences.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:03:08.200]   So I'm going to read three sections from the book. First needs no explanation, it's just really about the beginnings of my mother's breakdown, which lasted two years.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:15.200]   Broken.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:28.200]   "While Mom was away at the institution, Dad, to his credit, had realized that maybe part of Mom's breakdown had to do with them moving away from Narragansett Bay."
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:43.200]   Just a footnote here. What happened, and this is really hard, because to talk about Brewster North and myself, it's odd to split it, because Brewster North really is a persona for Spaulding Gray.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:58.200]   But what actually happened was that my mother was a very Christian woman and wanted to do the Christian thing so that my father wanted to move across the bay from Barrington, Rhode Island to East Greenwich, where his factory was relocating so he wouldn't have to commute.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:08.200]   My mother, thinking that this would be the Christian thing to do, was all prepared to do it until it came time to move, and then she couldn't sleep.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.200]   She was unable to sleep, she'd go up at two in the afternoon to get to sleep by midnight, and she started to go crazy, not sleeping.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:30.200]   "While Mom was away at the institution, Mom's breakdown had to do with their moving away from Narragansett Bay. Dad tried to buy the old house back from the new owners, but they were to have nothing of it.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:39.200]   Oh, they were sympathetic, of course, but they weren't going to move. They told Dad that Mom's missing the bay was only a symptom of some larger problem.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.200]   What could be larger than the problem of Narragansett Bay, except the ocean, I wondered.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:56.200]   Perhaps a woman might miss a bay so much that it would drive her mad. Only the Narragansett Indians would know about that, and they were all gone.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:10.200]   Maybe Mom was a reincarnation of an Narragansett Indian, I began to muse. Maybe she was tapped into the bay so much that she became the bay, but had no words for her condition.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   What does "I miss the bay" really mean? It all depends on who's saying it, right? And when Mom said it, we trembled, we all trembled.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:33.200]   Dad had a good sense to rent a bathhouse for Mom down at the coast at Bonnet Shore. Of course, that was not the same as stepping out on the lawn and having your head open up over the bay, but at least it was the ocean.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:41.200]   We had to drive 45 minutes to get there, which is a problem because we had to go down Route 2 by Rhode Island standards, a rather fast and crowded highway.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   I could see how driving on that road could make Mom real confused, especially since she was on some sort of medication, when she had just returned from having these electric shock treatments.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   So I always drove her to the beach. She hadn't made any friends on this side of the bay, and I couldn't bear seeing her go alone. But the truth was, I was sure that she wouldn't make it to the beach by herself.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:19.200]   On nice summer days, we tried to get to the beach as often as we could. At first, the shock treatment seemed to be working pretty well, because except for the occasional bird flutter in her eye, she apparently was coping, which put Dad at ease.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:32.200]   So Mom and I had a few days that were actually quite relaxed. We lay on the beach and dozed in the sun, both of us catching up on our much-needed sleep, while the distant waves and children's voices played like lulling music in our ears.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   But sometime around the second week Mom was home, it slowly started up again. The effects of the shock treatment were wearing off. She turned on those old "what ifs," those old "maybe I should have," the regret mechanism began.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:57.200]   She'd say things like, "Maybe I should have been a better mother. Do you really think that? Or maybe I should have gone to Spain when Coleman invited me and I had enough money to go, when I had the money to go visit him.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:06.200]   Or maybe I shouldn't have stolen you boys away from your father." And then she turned to me and said, "Do you think I stole you away from your father? Do you think that I was a good mother?"
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:18.200]   These questions made me very uneasy and confused. Deep down inside I thought that she'd been a good mother. If she'd been a good mother, I'd been able to be not there. I'd be somewhere else with my own woman.
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   I could have been able to have flown the nest by then. I wanted in the worst way to fly the nest, to get out, but still I couldn't.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:41.200]   When I was sixteen, my brother Coleman was nineteen, Mom would sometimes take a bath upstairs in the upstairs bathroom and not lock the door. And Cole and I, instead of using the downstairs bathroom, would go upstairs and pee while we looked over our shoulder at her.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:57.200]   It was like this kind of odd peep show. She let us look as long as we wanted, which was never long enough before we could get a good and steady look, Dad would come to the bottom of the stairs and shout, "Are you fellows?" Dad always called us fellows when reprimanding us.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:10.200]   "Are you fellows up there in that bathroom with your mother again? I don't like that one bit. And I don't want to have to come up there." Dad didn't like it. That was one of the few things I can remember him thinking was wrong.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:21.200]   On those frantic summer nights, after her return from the sanitarium, I would often try to calm Mom down by taking her to the movies, just to get us both out of the house and give Dad a relief.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   There were no Bergman films, no new Bergman films around, and Mom recently had seen Sound of Music at the sanitarium. So one night I made a big mistake. I took Mom to the recently released film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:48.200]   She wanted to go because she had this fascination with the life of Virginia Woolf. I'm not sure that she knew Virginia Woolf's books all that well, but she did know the story of how Woolf ended her life by filling her pockets with rocks and walking into a river.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:57.200]   She seemed to know the story as well as she knew the story of how Hart Crane, one depressed morning, walked off the stern of a cruise ship in the Gulf of Mexico, never to be seen again.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:14.200]   At that time, I didn't know what effect the film would have on Mom. I did notice how quiet she was as we rode home, but didn't find out how disturbed she really was until Dad told me the following morning, he said, "I think you took your mother to the wrong movie last night."
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:30.200]   "She's so upset, we may have to take her back to the sanitarium for shock treatments." At that time, I felt like saying, "Well, why didn't you take her to the movies then? You choose a good film to take her to." Outside of The Ten Commandments, which wasn't on the summer circuit that year, I didn't know what to choose.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   Some years back, I had taken Mom to see The Ten Commandments and she just loved it.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:48.200]   Well, it did turn out that Virginia Woolf was a mistake because Mom completely identified with the role of Martha, which was played by Elizabeth Taylor. In fact, Dad told me that Mom thought she was Martha the next morning.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   She went into one of those funky tailspins. I had to spend the next beautiful summer day indoors with her while she flew around the house like a frightened bird again, like that bird that couldn't get out.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:06.200]   That was the bad day. I remember it well because it was the day when she first told me right out how she planned to do it, how she planned to do away with herself.
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:19.200]   The whole morning, she was pulling her hair and picking at her ears until they bled. She had a little bald spot now in the back of her head from tearing her hair out, just like people in the movies when they're supposed to be going mad.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:28.200]   I would try to calm her down by reading to her from my favorite book of the time, Alan Watts's Psychotherapy East and West. But this didn't seem to help at all.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:36.200]   She wanted to read from The Christian Science and Health by Mary Baker Eddy, but she couldn't sit still long enough to read.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:43.200]   So at last, sometime in mid-morning, when she seemed to be about ready to pop, Mom began calling her Christian Science practitioner on the phone.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:50.200]   And she just stood there repeating after him what he told her, which seemed to be rather incoherent passages from The Science and Health.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:11:04.200]   I was never sure what he was saying to her because Mom would repeat it, halting, confused, things like, "Era is unreal because untrue. All reality is God and his creation harmonious and eternal.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:14.200]   That which he creates is good and he makes all that is made." Then there was a long sentence which Mom was barely able to repeat back to him, back to the practitioner,
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:20.200]   because she was too distracted, perhaps by the raving image of Elizabeth Taylor playing Martha in her mind.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   But she was able to get out just once that she said it slowly back to him, like a child trying to memorize a secret code. She said it once, all the way through.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   "Therefore, the only reality of sin, sickness and death is the awful fact that unreality seem real to the human erring mind until God strips off that disguise."
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   The practitioner went on as Mom paced and pulled and stretched the phone cord until it almost broke, pulling the phone off the wall, almost pulling the phone off the wall.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:12:02.200]   As she repeated the phrase over and over, "The science of mind disposes of all evil. Truth, God is not father of era. Man is not matter, he is spirit. Man is made in the image and likeness of God."
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:13.200]   Then the practitioner hung up and Mom held the phone and looked at it with a crazy scowl, like a little kid who had finally managed after years to get in touch with Santa Claus on the telephone.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   And right in the middle of asking for everything she ever wanted, got cut off. Then Mom hung up and began to pace again, and tear at her hair, and pick at her ears, and try to repeat the phrases that the practitioner told her.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:30.200]   But they came out all mixed up and broken, like, "Disposes of evil. Man is not era. Era is not man."
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   I just sat there on the couch, I just sat there, staring at her, thinking, "What the fuck is happening to this woman? The whole world is breaking down and falling apart. The whole house is shifting."
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:47.200]   I was getting dizzy and I had to run outside where I threw up green stomach bile and ended up with dry heels.
[00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   When I came back in, the frantic bird-like creature was running around from window to window as though she couldn't get out.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   That was the day I clearly saw, once again, how like a sky hook that wasn't there when she needed it, the Christian science wasn't working for Mom.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:15.200]   It was one of those "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps" situations. But there were no more bootstraps. One part of the mind has to be the bootstraps for the other part, and all the parts of Mom's mind seem to be gone.
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:23.200]   By late morning, Mom had decided to take a bath. I wanted to trust her, but I couldn't stop myself from pacing outside the bathroom door.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:29.200]   Calling in every so often over the sound of the running water, the sound of the light splashing in the tub, produced even more fear in my mind.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   "Are you alright in there?" I called in. But there was no answer, just little sounds of water splashing. I was sure she hadn't a straight edge razor.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:45.200]   I knew we didn't have one in the house, and I didn't think that she'd be capable of driving anywhere to purchase one.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:56.200]   After her bath, Mom seemed calmer. She came out dressed in her pink robe, looking just like a normal suburban housewife, and curled up on the couch to read her Christian Science monitor.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   I thought, now, that she was a little calmer, it might be good to try again to introduce her to a few well-chosen passages from Alan Watts.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:15.200]   But Mom was not about to hear it. As soon as I started to read to her, she lifted the newspaper up to make a kind of paper wall between us.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:26.200]   I put my finger, I put all my anger into my index finger, curled it back tight against my thumb, fired, and hit the paper wall with a hard snap. Pop!
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.200]   My finger exploded against the newspaper like a shot, and Mom almost jumped off the couch.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   Then, quickly, recomposing herself, she looked me clearly and directly in the eye, and with that crazy bird gone out of her now, she said,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   "Oh Brewster, oh Brewster dear, how shall I do it? How shall I do away with myself? Shall I do it in the garage with the car?"
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   I don't remember what happened after that. I don't know if I said anything back. I was amazed at her clarity. Something inside me knew that for her it was the time to go, that she'd made the decision.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   I made no effort to hide the keys to either of the cars. I did not tell Dad what she'd said to me. It was as though Mom and I had made one last private pact together.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   Perhaps I was trying to help some sad, sick part of her, which had now become almost the only part of her left, to die. But it was not as clear to me then as it seemed to be to her.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   That night, things got a little better before they got worse again. Every night, around the traditional cocktail hour, Mom would seem to get worse.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   She'd go into that double bind behavior, by then she was looking at Dad as her keeper, and she knew that if she acted weird in any way, that he'd pack her off to the sanitarium again.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:16:10.200]   But the effort to act sane only made her more insane. Every night, just before Dad was due home, she would go try to make dinner, and end up standing over the stove, staring out the window into the encroaching woods like some fearful pilgrim anticipating an Indian attack.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   She'd just stand there, stamping her saddle shoes, which made her look like a weird cheerleader. She'd stamp and stand and stamp and stare, and trying to get together and cook frozen peas, saying over and over like, "Don't let your father see me this way. I'm alright, I'm okay, I'm a perfect reflection of God, there is no error. Please don't let your father see me this way."
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:41.200]   Then Dad would come home and give her a peck on the cheek, and she'd relax a little bit, and ease into making the rest of the dinner, bird-like, mad bird-like flutters of panic surfacing here and there again.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   Then Dad would fix himself a tall bourbon, and seeing that crazy bird in there again, would begin to realize things weren't going so well.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   It was just the three of us then. Topher was away with Graham, and Cole was in Spain studying some dead existential Spanish writer.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:06.200]   The three of us were remained in this strange kind of triangle. I was afraid to pull out because I thought that the whole thing would collapse.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:15.200]   Only a void would be left, some dark, yawning, impossible gap, only darkness after so many years of shared history, of good and bad times together.
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   Odd, or worse than odd, that it should come to this after all these years, the mother bird gone mad, and yet that night, who's afraid of Virginia Woolf, and yet that night after who's afraid of Virginia Woolf,
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   we were still able to rally, after all the confusion and madness of the day, and Mom's confessions of wanting to do away with herself, we were still able to rally around Dad's surprising suggestion that we all go to the movies together.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:56.200]   At last, Dad had come through with flying colors. Not only did he want to go to the movies, but he wanted to go to a drive-in to see, of all things, Mary Poppins, which he probably thought would be a healthy antidote to the horrors of Virginia Woolf.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   I laughed to myself at the thought of Virginia Woolf meeting Mary Poppins and some stark New England Moor.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:16.200]   We went in Mom's car, a red Corvair convertible. It was a warm summer night, and Dad even put the top down. At the last minute, I thought it might be fun for me to try to get in free.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   So I took a blanket off the back seat, lay down on the back floor, covered myself. I could tell that Dad was proud in some way about, almost like he thought I was being enterprising or something.
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   For a moment, Mom even slipped back into her old normal self, and suddenly we were all together again. Mom and Dad were sitting in the front seat like lovers, and I was wrapped in the blanket on the back floor like a child waiting to be born.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   The following day, things took a turn for the worse. Mom hadn't slept that night, she became like an anxious bird again, and when Dad went to pack up her little suitcase to take her back to the sanitarium, she got even wilder, running from room to room, trying to avoid being caught, and put back in that cage for those awful shock treatments she couldn't bear.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:18.200]   At last, completely exasperated, Dad asked me to help round her up and get her into the Corvair, which by now had the top up. She tried to call her Christian Science practitioner, but Dad wouldn't allow it.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:33.200]   He made her get in the front seat between the two of us so she wouldn't try to jump out. I was as firm as I could be with her, but my words sounded hollow and distant, as if I were doing a bad reading of someone else's script.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:38.200]   "Come on, Mom, we are only trying to do what's best for you."
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   The trip to the sanitarium was one of those rides that takes no time and forever. At last, when we were right outside the heavy stone gates, so different from the Happy Gates of the drive-in movie the night before, Mom pulled her hand away from mine, and putting both hands over her mouth,
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:19.200]   she looked up at the gates of the sanitarium, taking her hands away, she cried out in horror, "Oh my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:36.200]   Now I think the book is a very humorous book, it's a very funny book, but it's also about a reaction to absence of mourning, or absence of grief, in the character of Bruce De Noth.
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   So what he continues to do is act out a lot, rather than grieve, and of course can't find the right place to be ever, he's in constant motion, so that's the kind of impossible vacation, you can't vacate, so he's always on these quests and trips,
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:21:12.200]   because he's feeling this enormous guilt, because his mother commits suicide when he's in Mexico, so he's not there for it, he returns only to find ashes in a box, and so he is able to have a relationship with a woman named Meg,
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   and later on in the book, here in this passage I'm going to read, that he and Meg, one of their quests go to India, Meg is going to India to buy Kashmiri rugs to sell in the flea market,
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:45.200]   and Brewster is going to visit Rajneesh in Pune, because he's sexually obsessed, this is one of the results of the absence of mourning, he's become a sexual obsessive, and he wants to get laid endlessly, and he's heard that you can do this in Pune,
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:22:03.200]   the sexiest sounding town in India, at the Rajneesh Puram, in 1976 this is, and he is accompanying Meg, his girlfriend over there, and she's going to split off, and he can go do what he wants, and she says I'm going to buy a rug, something's disease free and lasting,
[00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:22.200]   you can go to the ashram or do what you want in Pune, and then we'll hitch up later, so Meg does go off and buys these rugs, she imports to America to try to make a living from that, and Brewster goes to visit Rajneesh, but is absolutely unable to put on orange,
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:38.200]   it's repulsive, it's a color he can't bear, and everyone's wearing orange in the ashram, and he is the only one there that's wearing beige pajamas in the whole ashram, and can't bow down to this man, cannot do it, but he's there, and he's going through hell, because he's gone all the way there,
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:58.200]   but finds it very difficult to bow down, and so he flies back with Meg eventually, having failed, but his failure at having accomplished this sexual orgy that he fantasized, assaults him, and he can only visualize what he would have done had he stayed in India,
[00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:12.200]   and he's obsessed with the perfect orgies that would have happened, and when he gets to Amsterdam he gets sexually obsessed, because what's happening is that his Kundalini is beginning to come up, instead of India, in Amsterdam, in the wrong place,
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:30.200]   and he gets obsessed with, and he wants to both, he's reading Norman Brown's Life Against Death, and he wants to integrate work and pleasure, he's got this Neo-Freudian idea where he wants to do the two, and he goes all around Amsterdam trying to do live sex shows,
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   but he can't find a partner, you see, and they won't employ him without a female partner, so he fails at that, has a wild time in a gay bath in Amsterdam, and for the first time in his life enters into passive sex with a man, and that really spins him out,
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:24:03.200]   and then Meg shows up from India, she's flying in on her own, and wants to go back to the States, see Bruce is not in good shape for the 4th of July bicentennial of all things,
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:13.200]   and convinces Bruce that he should go back, but when he gets to the airport he cannot make up his decision to get on the plane, and freaks out, and the bags have all been checked on the plane,
[00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:29.200]   and he asks the stewardess at the last minute, can the bags get off the plane, and she says we can call now and have them taken off, are you sure you want to stay, I said no, no, no, I do, I don't, he says yes, no, yes, no, well leave them on, I'll stay here in Amsterdam, I don't want the bags,
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:39.200]   she said I'm afraid you cannot fly without your bags, so he ends up accompanying his bags back to New York City, this is how he gets back, because he's riding with his bags,
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   he does not sit with his girlfriend Meg on the plane, she doesn't even know he's on, he's pretty flipped out, he gets back, and he feels that he cannot bear the bicentennial,
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:25:00.200]   he does not want to see fireworks, the tall ships, anything, he wants to hide out at his father's home in Rhode Island, and his father is remarried after his mother's suicide,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   and he's married a woman that lives down the road, whose husband drank himself to death shortly after Bruce's mother killed herself, so they both got together in that New England kind of way,
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:30.200]   to be drinking companions basically for the rest of their lives, and live in this ranch house that's kind of their pleasure dome, they both, actually the wife, the stepmother's son was in Vietnam,
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:43.200]   she was treated to heroin and was crashing with a bunch of other addicts in her farmhouse and burned the place down, so that house went, and Bruce's father sold the house where the suicide was,
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:52.200]   so now they're in their own pleasure dome, and Meg and Bruce are going to visit them at 4th of July to hide out.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:26:03.200]   Again, Babs and Dad married less than a year after both their mates did themselves in, I didn't blame them for that, it must have been hell to live alone, swamped in that painful memories,
[00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   Babs' family was less tolerant of the new marriage, and her older son was acting like Hamlet, when he complains about the mother getting married before the funeral meets a cold,
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   he'd have nothing to do with Dad or Babs after the wedding, her younger son was more demonstrative, he had just returned from Vietnam addicted to heroin and ended up burning down Babs' old farmhouse with all her antiques in it,
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   when he was stoned, crashing with a bunch of NAMM buddies, they got out before the fire got them, but the farmhouse was a total loss, by then Dad and Babs had moved into their new home,
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   just down the road from that dark spot where Mom had died in the driveway, some history of pain, I went over again myself out loud to Meg, who stared ahead at the holiday rush,
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:27:03.200]   Meg is driving the van, holiday rush like a freaked out fighter pilot trying to land her plane, as we pulled into the black asphalt driveway, we saw the whole yard as an immaculate stage setting that gave our eyes some rest after that hectic highway,
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   it was a blessed order, perhaps the result of a fascist mind, but certainly the best part of it, the fresh cut lawn is well kept as a golf course, the flagpole with American flag fluttering slightly in a gentle southeasterly breeze up from Narragansett Bay,
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:29.200]   which lay in a distance far below, Dad and Babs must have been on the lookout for us, most likely for the entire morning's activity, because as soon as Meg parked our van, they came out the front door onto the flagstone terrace to greet us,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:42.200]   Dad cried, "Hi Ho! Hi Ho! Hi Ho!" in some strange parody of a party voice, like an actor who is standing close but pretending on stage, but he's making the voice sound as though it's coming from far away,
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   "Hi kids!" Babs said, and Meg and I both delivered the obligatory pecks on Babs's weathered leathery face with a rosy glow of ruptured capillaries,
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   then there was the obligatory bundle of why a hug with Dad, followed by the old quick pat on the back, an almost pleading signal for release from too much intimacy,
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:14.200]   we all backed away from each other, and Meg and I had arrived, as soon as I stepped into the house, the panic began, I kept having flashes of India, Amsterdam, fantasies of Bali,
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:31.200]   I kept thinking, I could be in Bali now rather than here, every time I thought that I'd realized that I wasn't in either place, I wasn't in Rhode Island and I wasn't in Bali, I was stuck like some tortured ghost in a self-created limbo between one place I'd seen too much of and another place I'd never seen at all,
[00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:43.200]   when I saw Dad's bright blue swimming pool out the living room window, it occurred to me that that was exactly why I wanted to be there, that was the reason I'd come home in the first place, I'd come home so that I could swim in Dad's pool,
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:53.200]   I sensed that the only thing that could bring me back into this world was an immersed myself in it and I rushed to charge into my speedo swimsuit, while Meg brought in the bags into the guest room,
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:29:03.200]   Babs went into the kitchen to start dinner and Dad followed me around the house asking me what I was doing, as I did the obvious and then commented on it for him,
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   now I'm changing into my swimsuit Dad, now I'm going for a swim in the pool Dad, no Dad don't worry I won't drown Dad, I won't drown it's alright, stepping into the backyard was like walking into a Kodachrome Hollywood postcard synthetic reality,
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:39.200]   the very unreality of it allowed me to be there as I stepped out a little chilled in my new slim fatless body and string in my speedo brief pulled tight pulling up the slack, above the pool was a powder blue sky with streaks of pink from the descending sun as the sliver of the new moon had just been seen,
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   below the expansive blue framed by a high wooden fence and surrounded by a black patio was the other blue, that magnificent protected pool and it's deck of dark green astroturf,
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   I could feel the turfs cool oily resilience under my bare feet as I moved toward the perfectly heated water and plunged, that dive and the mad splash facing down beating strokes carried me to the other end of the pool and made me feel that I had arrived at last, I was in my body at last,
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   but the feeling was almost instantly broken by Dad's following me around the edge of the pool with his ongoing chattering commentary about how he had measured the temperature to steady 76 degrees all day and didn't I want to have a look at the new automatic robot pool cleaner,
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:39.200]   it was also broken by Babs calling from the kitchen window, my goodness Brewster, we're going to have to put some fat on that body of yours, looks like India's turned you two kids into skeletons, I was so excited by the fact that Babs acknowledged our trip to India that I didn't care that she'd broken the picture of perfection,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   I was still swimming when my body sensed or anticipated a kind of intuition of fluids and liquids, the encroaching cocktail hour, the cast of melancholy light breaking over the tops of distant elms and maples sent turn swallows and sparrows flying home to their night nests and left me sad, empty, lonely, chirping robins and distant lawns,
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   all of this made the entire swimming pool feel like a giant dry martini and gave me a sign that it was at last cocktail hour, I pulled myself out, wrapped myself in Babs big fluffy brightly colored bath towel and went into change,
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   as Meg and I passed through the dustless posh wall to wall carpeted living room, we saw Babs nervously thumbing through house and garden, waiting for dad, who paced by one of the antique grandfather clocks to give the official bartenders okay, the clock said five of five and I could feel that familiar tense anticipation grow in the room,
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   as the hands of the clock slowly moved round and struck 12345 in all the tension of the day gave way as dad said it last in his formal bartenders voice.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:54.200]   May I fix you a drink, Mrs. North
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   Babs put down her magazine as if she was surprised by this offer.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:07.200]   She just sat there for a moment pretending to consider it as if she might at any moment say no and order cranberry juice instead.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:18.200]   And then in the most casual tone she would could deliver and then she should live it as convincingly as a good actress might Babs said, Well, I don't mind if I do, Mr. North.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   Do you think you could fix me a dry martini with three onions?
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:36.200]   And Mr. North answered, Well, I don't know why not. And they were off for the glorious cocktail ritual Babs going into the TV room to turn on the local news while dad headed for the bar to begin his measuring and pouring.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:44.200]   Soon the tinkle of ice against glass blended with the local news and music played from every corner of the room before dad.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   Before mom died in the early years, while we were growing up, there was no formal cocktail hour in our home, perhaps because mom didn't drink and dad drank very little in those days, he kept his bottles out of sight.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   When he opened the liquor cabin in the dining room, he always took a bottle of bourbon out and measured it out carefully. He used to make two tall bourbons and waters when he drank sequentially just to relax.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:18.200]   But now the dad had a wife who was a drinking partner, the bottles were proudly displaced sitting in a fully equipped bar with lots of cocktail accessories. It looked like a little altar.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:27.200]   Although Babs had a vision of herself as a gourmet cook, it was not so easy for her to drink and cook gourmet meals at the same time.
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:36.200]   We were usually doomed to raw meat and oversteamed vegetables. For some reason, it never went the other way. We never ended up with raw vegetables and overcooked meat.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:45.200]   I guess it was because dad's needs. Only dad knew how to cook steak while completely high in bourbon and dad wasn't cooking that night.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:53.200]   He was waiting for the fourth of July for the big barbecue. That night, Babs served us frozen frog's legs.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   They came out on a plate and looked like the hairless amputated legs of Lilliputian Olympic runners.
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   Meg and I both rolled our eyes and looked across at each other. It was funny how Babs' cooking was bringing Meg and me closer together.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:21.200]   Babs slipped the hairless little legs, garnished the posse on a TV table somewhere in the middle of the national news report about tall ships.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:29.200]   Meg could barely touch them, but I was drunk enough to eat them whole and asked for seconds.
[00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:37.200]   After dinner and dessert, somewhere in the middle of the odd couple, Babs, with the help of Meg, cleared the dishes away and put them in the dishwasher,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   starting the last annoying mechanical grind before dad's white noise box took over to drown out the sound of night crickets.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   Still, without a word of inquiry about India, dad and Babs began to get ready for bed.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:58.200]   Babs disappeared into the bedroom. Dad performed his last evening rituals, checking the home weather unit for wind velocity and barometric pressure,
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   instructing me as to what lamps not to touch, turn off because they are on automatic timers. Then he retired in Babs and he retired to that white noise box.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:19.200]   Meg went to the guest room to read and I went for a welcome walk alone.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:26.200]   I wandered in the warm night down the long country lane that led, if you followed it all the way, past the place of mom's death,
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:34.200]   onto the charred remains of Babs' family farmhouse. Protected from fear and anxiety by a warm glow of alcohol, I wandered and staggered under the stars.
[00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:42.200]   Nothing could touch me now. And for a minute, I even considered walking all the way to our old house at the end of Shandy Lane to meditate on mom,
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.200]   to try to see that night in July I had missed when I was in Mexico with Meg.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:53.200]   But it was too far to walk and too painful to dwell on, so I decided instead to try to sneak into dad's pool and swim naked.
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:36:02.200]   I had a feeling I could pull it off if I was quiet and didn't splash. Taking my clothes off brought back the most delicious body memories from childhood,
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:11.200]   of running naked on summer nights under a full moon, running nude through the white statuary in the yard of the mansion across the street from a honeysuckle boyhood home.
[00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:22.200]   And I suddenly wanted to have myself and I rubbed my hands all over my warm naked body trying to surprise it with some foreign touch, some unexpected move.
[00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:31.200]   I slipped into the heated pool and without a sound I swam on my back, looking up at the stars. At the same time, I ran my hands down over my new body,
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:40.200]   my ass, my thin thighs, and then they opened and spread and pumped like those fully alive animation of those frog's legs we had earlier.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:49.200]   When I got to the bedroom, I found Meg asleep with the light on. Her pixie haircut was still damp like a duck's tail from her shower.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   And she looked fresh and innocent on those cotton sheets. She was almost a child again in my eyes, except for that one troubled blue vein that slightly raised on her forehead.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:08.200]   I stood there wondering how could I still go on loving, how could she still go on loving me when I seemed to be doing all I could to drive her away.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:17.200]   It was a miracle, but I was able to sleep the whole night through and even woke up in the morning to one glorious moment of forgetfulness.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:26.200]   When the only delicious sensation of being wrapped in those cotton sheets was real. Then the panic set in again, the crazy images of India, Ladakh, Amsterdam swept over me.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   As soon as I felt that anxious bale of wire feeling in my legs, I thought the best thing to do is to jump out of the pool and work it out.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:41.200]   Dad and Babs already had been up for a long time, puttering and muttering. "Hi ho, hi ho, hi ho," Dad cried in his pretend faraway voice.
[00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   Babs was just ever in the kitchen rinsing the breakfast dishes by hand as she stared out over the still blue pool and then stacking them completely clean in the dishwasher.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   "Good morning, Brew," she said in her Rhode Island twang. I said good morning back and the both of them staggered out to the pool still slightly hungover, I was still slightly hungover and half asleep.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:14.200]   Dad followed me out asking did I have the right towel? How did I sleep? What did I want for breakfast? Were Meg and I going to eat breakfast together and did I want Babs to fix it for us?
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   Did we want bacon that was already made in the warmer? This was followed by numerical rundown of the morning's readings of the gauges of the house, air temperature, barometric pressure, wind philosophy and temperature of the pool.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:37.200]   Never once did he ask me what it was like to travel all the way to India and back. In fact as I stood poised about to dive I realized that Dad and Babs still had not asked me one question about India.
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:49.200]   A big splash and I was in the pool again and for a moment I was almost in the moment again. It was all just water in motion and something I call me in motion in it.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   This was the only time I ever understood my boundaries because the thing outside of me was so apparently different, so liquid, so other, so unlike those solid things, those people and lawns and cars and mountains and buildings and trees.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:14.200]   It was such a great curative this thrashing and splashing and I wondered how I, I wondered as I swam back and forth from one end of the pool to the other how would I survive back in New York City without a swimming pool.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   The swim woke me up and brought me back to life and I managed to get through Dad's living room interrogations about water temperature without much problem. In the bedroom I peeled off my wet swimsuit, dried myself with Babs's prize fluffy pink towel, slipped naked into bed beside Meg who rolled over smiling.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   But when she saw my face hers took on a kind of worried look. She wanted to know what was wrong. I told her I just had a swim and I felt fine, but she knew that I was wired and hungry for relief through what she called manic sex.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   Please Brewster, Meg begged, I just don't feel turned on in your father's house. Don't you know that? Haven't you noticed that by now? Let's get up and do something productive. Let's go out and wash and Simonize the van before we go to the beach.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:18.200]   Alright, I said groaning slightly as I reluctantly dragged myself semi erect out of bed. We can go wash the car but I won't go to the beach because it's Fourth of July and I don't want to see it. I just want to pretend that the whole weekend doesn't exist.
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   Meg was in better spirits after breakfast but I was groaning more. I was groaning between bites of toast and swallows of Babs's dreadful instant coffee. Dad was hovering around me washing and drying every utensil I put down on the table for more than 10 seconds. I'd pick it up again and find it was to my surprise completely clean.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:50.200]   Meg was reading the paper oblivious. She had a way of falling into the news. After all of this and a couple of Babs's camel regulars which made me cough and wheeze, Meg and I set out to wash and Simonize the van.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:41:10.200]   Dad was out there running the flag up the flagpole and I knew what was driving me nuts. On holidays one was supposed to have a good time and I felt under such pressure to have one but I didn't know how. I never had a good time on holidays. People were supposed to let loose and laugh and they usually did but I usually heard them at a distance and it drove me nuts.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   Sure they had to be working real hard jobs that they hated so that they would be able to unwind from, right? I was just one of these post-adolescent searcher drifters going from job to job then falling through the cracks into anxiety when I wasn't working. I didn't know how to have fun.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   After the van was Simonized and clean and shiny we stood back and looked at it, Meg's smile enjoying the pleasure not only of a job well done but also the transformation of the van into something like a smiling green truck in a storybook. I stood and looked at Meg's face enjoying her enjoyment.
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   Meg, my go-between. The van was like a green toy in a black slightly mud-stained asphalt framed by a perfect green lawn under a loving red, white and blue American flag and for a moment it all held together like some physical poem of itself. A poem of the real world captured.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:20.200]   But that vision gave way to my internal films again. Me and Bali hanging out in some expatriate hippie commune. Me just hanging out in timeless splendor with some great interconnected unspoken agreement between man and woman doing what I couldn't tell just lying there stone looking up into not all that meaningful palm trees.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   And yet I thought in the face of meaningless death it must take great courage to do nothing. To just do nothing at all.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:43.200]   The rest of the day was spent out by the pool waiting for the end of the day to come. Waiting for cocktail hour. Meg and I lay in white hot noonday limbo light Meg reading Dads and Babs's endless collection of glossy magazines.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:54.200]   She thumbed through them seeming content did almost anything. She could switch from the magic mountain to house and garden without concentration expression on her face changing once.
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:43:04.200]   She concentrated on everything that she did and I loved her for it. When I wasn't watching her concentrate I was trying to concentrate but I never was able to find an object to concentrate on.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:22.200]   I was definitely stuck in what I call discursive mind. Bouncing from association to association reduced to moving in a triangle going from reading and underlying life against death to fantasies of Bali and my new obsession with saving drowning bugs from my father's swimming pool.
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:28.200]   By midday my obsession of saving the drowning bugs had taken over.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   Dad and Babs stayed indoors. They didn't lie in the sun for fear of skin cancer.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   From where I sat watching all these struggling bugs I could hear Dad and Babs in their endless and nain putterings confronting background sounds like white noise.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:44:01.200]   Occasionally the puttering sounds would be broken by little flare ups between them when their random orbits collided or when Dad would need help finding his ice cream maker that he had most likely hidden from himself in some boozy haze and now too ashamed to admit it he was turning on Babs and accusing her of hiding it.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:13.200]   Meg was lost in Yankee Magazine as I got up and discovered to my horror just how many different kinds of bugs were drowning in Dad's pool. I'd never seen so many in such different stages of panic.
[00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:26.200]   I didn't know the names of most of them but I was able to identify one or two big repulsive June bugs, some grasshoppers, a few Japanese beetles, house flies and most important one good luck lady bug.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:38.200]   At last I went after them with a broken branch I found at the edge of the house near Babs's rose garden. Then I shifted to the pool cleaning net in order to rescue more of them in one sweep.
[00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:56.200]   I spent most of the day pulling each and every bug out placing on a safe little dry spot on the rubber edge of the astroturf. It gave me such a feeling of accomplishment to watch them dry off and kind of shake and slowly come back to life and creep away over that green astroturf into the rose garden.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:12.200]   And yes a sense of meaning gradually crept into me as I thought all these bugs had been saved today because I didn't go to Bali. When I finally looked up from the siege of drowning bugs I saw Meg asleep in the sun.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   Except for the raised blue vein in the center of her forehead she looked like peace. I noticed that the sound and puttering in the house had come to a halt capped off by Babs calling out the kitchen window, "Aren't you kids hungry for some lunch?" I wanted a beer more than I wanted lunch but I figured if I had lunch I could have a beer with it.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:51.200]   Dad had nothing but those damn Miller lights around so I had four to relax after I had this damn traumatic bug rescue. All the time I was eating my tuna salad sandwich though I kept seeing more and more bugs step off the giant edge of the pool and fall in and struggle on their backs until I had to put down my sandwich and go down and rescue them.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:46:07.200]   I never got back to life against death that day I spent the day saving bugs. At last one glorious moment in the pool free of bugs and I plunged in to refresh myself. I felt that fluid liquid feeling and in no time it was blessed cocktail hour again.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:27.200]   We'd almost gotten through the day without the sound of a parade of fireworks at all. What a blessing I thought as I did my frantic laps from one end of the pool to the other. We showered and dressed, both Meg and I dressed in white, me and my cotton Indian pants and Meg in her white cotton dress and we went back to sit by the pool.
[00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:43.200]   We drank together with Dad and Babs and the evening brought a coolness to our suntanned bodies under white cotton. After I had many drinks, light beers with scotch poured in to beef them up and bunches of light peanuts that tasted like styrofoam.
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:47:02.200]   Dad lit the coals and brought out the bloody bicentennial slab of raw meat. As soon as Babs noticed that the flies and mosquitoes she suggested that we eat indoors. That became the new overriding topic. Should we eat out or in? Was it too cold out? Was it too hot in? Were there too many bugs?
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:19.200]   The sizzling, the steak smoke rose up like a cowboy's campfire and Dad said that the steak smoke rising straight up like that was a sign of continuing good weather. As if it mattered. As if it mattered I thought, how would we behave differently if it rained?
[00:47:19.200 --> 00:47:37.200]   Dad and Babs got in a panic every time Meg or I opened the screen door because they said we were letting in flies. I kept thinking of all the flies in India and all the flies I'd saved from drowning that very afternoon, which are probably the ones that were following me into the house to celebrate being saved.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:55.200]   In the middle of the holiday bedlam of steak smoke and flies, Babs, after about three and a half martinis, got out her antique fly gun and went after them. It was this old tin gun that was supposed to once belong to Roger Williams and it was worth, I was sure, a small fortune.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:13.200]   There was nothing to this little gun. It was like a toy tin handgun painted bond red with a spatula like device that bent back and hitched on a little trigger, which when you pulled it and released the spatula and if you were the proper distance from the fly, smacked the bug dead.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:27.200]   It was such a funny, simple, stupid little thing but no one was laughing. Everyone was dead serious and I wanted so much to laugh but I couldn't laugh, I guess, because I kept thinking, gee, this is funny.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:34.200]   I've saved all these drowning flies just so they can be smashed by an antique fly gun that once belonged to Roger Williams.
[00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:47.200]   Dad didn't think it was funny. He kept yelling, put that damn fly gun down, sis, and get yourself a proper fly swatter. By now Meg was off reading a brief history of Providence plantations and last of the fading light.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:49:10.200]   The steak on our plates was rare. The steak on our plates was definitely rare. It was very, very rare and the blood from the meat attracted mosquitoes and droves. Finally Dad got out his big bug bomb and set it off around our feet and we sat there with the poison streaming up around our ankles as we tore into that raw meat.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:27.200]   I bit into my steak and all the juice and the blood immediately put me into a sense of desire. The more I chewed, the more I wanted, the more I ate, the less satisfied I felt. It was like chew, chew, chew, angry chew and then big gulps and swallows, wash it down with more light beer.
[00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   Meg couldn't eat it. It was too rare for her. She asked for the charred piece at the end. It was real toasted and toasted fat on it. Dad drank steak blood from a serving spoon. Babs kill flies. Meg rolled her eyes back in her head and I went back to Bali in my mind.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   I was lying there naked in a hammock stretched between two palm trees under the stars and there were no bugs anywhere.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   After dinner I tried to introduce something new by offering to give Babs and Dad a slide show of our trip to India. And to my amazement, they were not completely closed to the idea. So while Babs and Meg cleared dishes, I helped Dad set up the screen and slide projector.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:37.200]   We set it up in the living room which was a major project and Dad was groaning louder than I was groaning. For both of us it seemed a joyless task. Then Meg got out the slides which we were both very proud of and we showed them alternating our random comments as we traced our trip from Delhi up to Kashmir up to the dock and back to Delhi again.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:59.200]   It looked like a story from someone else's life. Meg and I looked like characters in someone else's movie. Babs and Dad hardly reacted to it at all. After the slide show was over, Babs said, "Well, you kids really had some trip and you're lucky to be back, aren't you?"
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:15.200]   Neither Meg nor I responded to her rhetorical question. We just got up and made motions like Dad and Babs and got ready for bed. Everyone went to bed and I stayed up in the den drinking light beer to ease me down from all those hectic relaxation, the hectic relaxation of that day.
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:30.200]   Then I dug out the old family album and poured over those idyllic photos of Mom and Dad's courtship. Those old pictures of them on a moose hunt in Maine with Grandma North and her boyfriend, all of them standing on a big log with guns and hands smiling.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:47.200]   They looked like they were having such a great time. None of the faces in those photos had the existential puzzled trouble look that my face had in our India slides. No, those moose hunt photos radiated smiling innocent hope of anticipation of a new bright world to come.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   I went on slowly turning the pages following Mom and Dad's life through to me, their second son. Who in the early photos looked like a sour disgruntled prune head? Why was I so sour so early on I wondered? Was I born into the world that way?
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:23.200]   I got up to fetch another beer but there were no more beers in the kitchen refrigerator. I would have to go into the basement to bring up a six pack from Dad's basement refrigerator. Switching on the basement light I started down the stairs. Halfway down I was seized with fear.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:41.200]   At first I couldn't imagine what was frightening me. And then I realized it was the fear that Mom's ghost was about to haunt me. I stood paralyzed on the stairs afraid that I would see Mom in some semi cremated state.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:53:02.200]   The way they say incinerating bodies look as they sit up from the extreme heat, popping and twisting like cooking slabs of bacon. I was afraid I would see her body now in my uncontrolled imagination the way I saw it in that vision in Mexico when she appeared to me in the flames of Olaf's fireplace around the time she had actually been cremated.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:28.200]   I didn't want to go into the basement but I wanted and really needed another beer so I moved fast. I felt Mom's deadly yawning dripping burn disturbed presence in every corner as I ran up the basement stairs with that six pack of Miller light in my hand. I could feel her hissing demon breath tearing at my backside. I could feel the dark charred spirit of Mom that had never at least by me been properly laid to rest.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:49.200]   By the time I got upstairs I was so upset I had to drink three more beers just to calm down. And as I drank them I remembered another ghost of Mom, less fearful, more depressing, more banal. It came to me in recurring dreams I had of Babs and Dad with Mom moving like an unseen ghost between them.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:54:03.200]   Those dreams came just after Babs and Dad got married and moved into their new house. In the dream I would see Babs and Dad walking around their new kitchen trying out all their new electrical gadgets and appliances.
[00:54:03.200 --> 00:54:23.200]   And in the middle of it all was Mom, a less substantial figure dressed in a summer smock drifting like a transparent ghost, a hologram of herself through Babs and Dad who didn't see her and just went on filling the dishwasher with already clean dishes and turning on the trash masher and the electric can opener.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:36.200]   Grind, grind, grind.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   Brister deteriorates after the visit home. His Kundalini comes up extremely strong and he's bouncing off the walls. Meg can't handle it. Meg and friends want to commit him to Bellevue.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:17.200]   They take him to Bellevue and he's ready, he has to sign the papers in order to go in and the admitting doctor asks him what he does, who he is, what he does for a living and he gets very confused and says that he is, he strains to get to it but he finally says what he really wants to be and isn't yet.
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:32.200]   An artist, he says he's an artist. And the admitting doctor says oh I understand you sensitive artist, I play the clarinet myself. Brister is freaked by the fact that he plays the clarinet, if it was the oboe it would be another thing.
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:36.200]   This is just enough to make him not sign the papers.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:51.200]   So he doesn't go in to Bellevue. What his idea is, is that if he can make it to California, he's going to be alright because he's going to be at peace in Santa Cruz and San Francisco, he thinks that's the promised land.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:56:05.200]   And he has no money to make it there and he wants to go on the American Gypsy, it costs $69 and you just lie in a bed the whole way across, stoned I guess.
[00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:18.200]   So in order to ride across the California American Gypsy, he decides, because of this sexual thing again that's really taking him over, to try to make the money by making a pornographic film, acting in it.
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:35.200]   And so he goes up and applies for it and actually gets the job, doesn't have a partner, gets the job by lying to the director Bernie and tell him that he's just gotten back from Copenhagen where he's been working in lots of porn films.
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:47.200]   And he's come back because a member of his family died and he just wants to do a few films while he's over here before he goes back to Copenhagen. Bernie believes him and hires him and so this is Brister's first porn film.
[00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:57.200]   After Bernie and everyone else arrived, the shot was set up and all the actors were herded back into a small bedroom which served as a waiting room.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   We were all piled in this little side bedroom, a mixture of men and women just waiting to be called to do whatever it was we were asked in whatever combinations.
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:14.200]   I don't think anyone ever knew what the film was about. It wasn't as though anyone was reading scripts or studying lines or anything like that.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:24.200]   We were just hanging out. No one was even reading a book. There was a strange, somewhat perverse quality of privacy among us.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:36.200]   The actors and actresses didn't talk dirty, as you might imagine. They were all very discreet and proper, at least when it came to talking about what they did when they left the room and went on camera.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:55.200]   In a regular non-pornographic film, you might expect an actor or actress to come off camera all bubbly talking about how the scene went, but here the actors and actresses just came back with discreet little smirks on their faces and then lay around in states of semi-dress hanging out until they were called again. It was weird.
[00:57:55.200 --> 00:58:01.200]   But they were not at all private in the way they displayed themselves, particularly the women.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:27.200]   There was this one actress who drove me to distraction. She came back into the waiting room after she did whatever it was that she did and she rolled what she called a spliff, a little marijuana mixed with cigarette tobacco, and then just lounged back in a peach colored satin robe, cross her legs and bounce her foot until the robe slowly fell away to reveal this fantastic thigh nicely pruned bush.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   Then she let her robe fall open at her chest while she talked about her boyfriend and how he was a total grump when he didn't have his marijuana. "Just a big old grump," she said.
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   She talked about some trip they had taken to Hawaii together and how she thought it was going to be so spectacular, but her boyfriend was a total grump because he couldn't score some grass until the last day there.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:59:01.200]   I just sat there like a dumbstruck ten-year-old in a candy store. The sight of that woman made me crazy. I wanted to touch her all over. I wanted to be her slave.
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   I kept hoping that I'd somehow be paired up with her, but I figured that the chances were slim, real slim, because every time I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror, my face looked so sad and mad.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   I looked like Anton Anto in his last days. So I couldn't help making up my own porn film in my head about how this slinky lady would have me down on all fours with a dog collar around my neck, how she'd have me on a leash and command me to eat her all over.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:44.200]   I was sure that to have her would be total satisfaction. But any attempt at conversation just fell in between the beds. So I ended up talking to this guy, Gary. Gary was about my age, a nice enough guy.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:53.200]   He had a female partner. That's the only reason he said that he was able to get work, so much work in porn films. He was surprised to find that I had gotten work without a partner.
[00:59:53.200 --> 01:00:07.200]   Unless you're a porn star, it's very difficult to get work without a partner. Gary's partner was named Janine, and she looked like a star-struck starlet type, only she was just slightly off. She didn't have that pretty commercial look that makes you big for the movies.
[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:20.200]   There was too much going on in her face. You could see the doubt and anger. She couldn't hide it well. She couldn't plastic it over. And I figured that sort of turned off the casting people in legitimate films.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:34.200]   Janine and Gary were old friends and trusted each other enough to have functional sex on camera. Gary said they'd even had a good time sometimes, but that he didn't want to dwell on it, the good times too much, because he didn't want to get too attached.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:44.200]   He wanted to be able to leave the city when the time came. I was curious about Janine's story, but before we could get to it, Bernie, the director, came in, still wearing those damn reflective sunglasses.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:01:00.200]   And he came to me, and he called me out into the living room. I was very nervous, not having any idea what I was called out to do. But both to my relief and to my disappointment, the task turned out to be absolutely simple.
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:21.200]   All I had to do was walk by a bare-breasted woman who was being whipped with a little cat of nine tails by a man dressed like a pirate. It was not a violent scene. He was barely hitting her. I had to stand there, watch him whipper three times, look down at my watch, which props had just put on my wrist, then look up at the camera and say,
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:37.200]   "Oh, shiver my timbers." I do declare, "Three o'clock," right on the old nose. Then I just stroll out of the room, like some absent-minded professor. By now, they had me dressed in a very nice Palm Beach suit.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:57.200]   Anyway, there was no discussion of character or plot or who was supposed to be doing what or anything. I just decided to do my line reading like Woody Allen would have, and everyone laughed when I did it, and this made me feel real good. I felt like I'd accomplished something, like it was potent, like I had brought a little more laughter into the world, and I liked the feeling of that.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:11.200]   After my scene, which was done in three quick takes, I got to hang out against the wall while they did a setup for the following shot, just long enough to find a little out about the movie and the plot before Bernie called me back into the bedroom.
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:30.200]   One of the grips, who was real nice, told me that the film was about some sort of wrinkle-in-time situation in which a pirate ship comes out of the 18th century to land at Fulton Street in downtown Manhattan. These pirates have come to claim one of the crew who is now a Wall Street stockbroker and has almost forgotten he was a pirate in his past life.
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:49.200]   All he knows is that he has a fascination with pirate ships, and he gets an erection every time he sees a picture or model of a pirate ship. In fact, this grip told me that the star of the film had got to get a full engorged erection while a woman playing his secretary carried a clock shaped like a pirate ship through the room.
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:03:08.200]   They had shot that scene and he had been able to get erect just at the sight of the ship shaped clock. The grip told me that the star was a very good porn actor and much in demand because he never required a fluffer, which was the name of a woman who was paid just to get the man up for the scenes.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:21.200]   Before I could get any more information, Bernie took me back into the bedroom where I fell back into talking with Gary and again, at last, Gary and Janine and I were called to do a scene together.
[01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:37.200]   I was a little surprised that the three of us were called together, but at this point the whole lot was just completely surprising to me. Once we got undressed, we were led into another bedroom where the camera crew was all set up and waiting.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:51.200]   Without explaining how the scene fit into the plot of the movie, as if it was shooting some other film, Bernie simply described the shot to us. He told us that this was a shot he had been thinking about for a long time.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:04:05.200]   It was to be Gary and me just lying on our backs, limp, naked, relaxed, and then Janine was to appear in the doorway where she would slowly slip off her robe and we would gradually grow erect.
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:19.200]   Then there was this shot of us, or rather our cocks, becoming erect, like two kind of giant red asparagus growing out of a field of pubic hair. This is how Bernie described it.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:40.200]   And his description surprised me because it was unlike him, so poetic. After they got the shot of the two erections, Janine was to move in and we were to have this glorious menage à trois where Gary fucks Janine in the ass while she blows me at the same time.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:53.200]   It was definitely not poetic, and I had no idea how I was going to accomplish this rather intimate, complicated act in front of those sound and cameramen, not to mention Bernie and his god-awful reflective sunglasses.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:05:06.200]   I think both Gary and I were hoping that some workable fantasy would take over when the time came to get erect, but it didn't. Nothing happened to either of our cocks when Janine came through the door.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:21.200]   They just lay there, limp. I felt like I was on an operating table rather than a bed, and it was supposed to be an erotic situation. There were no fluffers available, so Janine was asked to please try to fluff us both.
[01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:38.200]   Then fluffers run to the door and make a grand entrance. So the work, and I mean work, began. Janine came over to the bed dressed only in a robe while Bernie paced to the side like a basketball coach and the cameramen adjusted the lenses and the boom.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   Men, the mood men fiddled with their booms. Jean began to fiddle and fluff with Gary and me. She started sucking on Gary's cock while she stroked mine with her hand. Then Gary was erect, but nothing was happening for me. I was numb.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:06:02.200]   There was nothing and no one in the room that was turning me on. After Janine got Gary hot, she began to suck on me, which seemed to help, but while she was doing that, Gary went soft.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:19.200]   So for a while, there was this back and forth, up and down like a sexual seesaw, one cock getting hard while the other went soft. Bernie continued to pace impatiently on the sidelines, back and forth. I just lay there like a little kid with my mouth piped trying not to scream.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:32.200]   I just lay there, getting done and watching this once important part of me inflate and deflate again and again. At last, Bernie had the good sense to clear the room so Janine could work on us in private.
[01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:55.200]   So leaving the cameras and booms set up, the whole crew left. Gary was to call them back when the task of dual erections was accomplished. Janine began to work on us again. Somehow she was able to get both of our cocks harded up at the same time, but now it all seemed like something going on far away, something I hardly felt a part of.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:04.200]   Gary called for Bernie and the crew and they all came running back in. But by the time they got set up again, Gary and I had begun to wither.
[01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:19.200]   And all they got were these two rather wilted dicks that were mostly held up by our hands and looked like a display of specimens in some medical journal, like erotic male members.
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   The next shot was not an unusual shot if you've seen porn films or porn magazines, you'd recognize the shot immediately. It was the old demeaning classic, demeaning that is for the woman who was getting used at both ends.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:44.200]   Janine was instructed to get on all fours, Gary was instructed to kneel behind her and fuck her in the ass while she sucked my cock. I was glad that I was the passive one in all of this.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:08:02.200]   As soon as Janine heard that there was going to be an anal intercourse in the shot, she called for her contract. Bernie's assistant came running with it and held it steady on the bed while Janine, naked on all fours, signed the anal intercourse clause, which provided exactly for $37 bonus.
[01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   Once again the room was cleared for us to work in private. Janine and Gary got the whole interconnected machine, Janine and I got this whole interconnected machine and all of its parts working away.
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:25.200]   And then Gary yelled, "Okay!" and the crew came running. Bernie was running up and down the sidelines like a coach for a winning team calling out, "Go, that's good, that's good!"
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:34.200]   Then to me, "Move around more North, make it look like you're enjoying it! Make sounds, broster, make noises, make some sounds, boy, will you?"
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:45.200]   And I could feel myself going limp as soon as he used the word "boy." In order to counteract that I went into a memory bank to come up with some useful fantasy.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:57.200]   I went somewhere else in my head, I went back to the Dom Square in Amsterdam and found a young Italian girl and brought her back to Hans' house and at last did it with her in the attic room.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:13.200]   That's where I was when Bernie called for the cum shot. Because there was only one camera, Gary came first, shooting his warm ward on Janine's back, rubbing it in with his hand for the close-up, a standard porn film technique he'd learned in the past.
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:27.200]   Then it was my turn, Bernie yelled, "Cum shot!" and Janine pulled her mouth away and I shot into the air. This left me with a very sad, empty feeling.
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:41.200]   Then it was over, just like that, it was over. We were done for the day. In fact, we were done with the film altogether. I was handed two crisp $50 bills and an envelope and sent home.
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:52.200]   That day I was certain of one thing, which was the first sense of certainty I'd had in some time. I was certain that my career in porn films was over.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:10:02.200]   I hadn't earned enough money to take a trip across the country, but I had earned enough money to go to Provincetown at last.
[01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:14.200]   Maybe, Provincetown at last, maybe that would be enough of a trip to make me feel like I had left Meg and allow me to return to her at last, triumphant man.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:23.200]   To make that short odyssey might be enough for now. I had to learn how to hang out and be on my own, spend money without being self-destructive.
[01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:34.200]   I needed a vacation. I needed to relax and learn how to laugh alone. I needed to learn how to enjoy without needing a witness. I had no trouble crying.
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:46.200]   My tears came out at random like gushing streams in the spring. Had the film been about a man crying at the slightest cue instead of getting erect, I could have become an overnight star.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:54.200]   I could cry, but I didn't laugh and I couldn't laugh. My laughter was always short circuited by instant report on the event.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:09.200]   It was as though I was all things that could make me laugh. It was as though I saw all things that could make me laugh coming at me in slow motion so that I had plenty of time to analyze them before they got to me.
[01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:24.200]   Then by the time they hit, by the time they got there, it was always, "Yes, yes, I see, I see, that's funny, yes, I understand, oh yes, I see why they're laughing now."
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:37.200]   Although that old loneliness was still there, I wanted to be laughing at it as well as crying. Thank you.
