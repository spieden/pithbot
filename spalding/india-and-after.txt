[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.880]   Civilian. One engaged in civil pursuits, distinguished from a soldier, etc.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.600]   One and a half.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   So in order to keep my distance, I decided to divide them into three categories.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.800]   The poets and losers I put at the top of the list, then the poets and madmen and the losers
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.600]   were second, and then the professionals were at the bottom. And I decided I would go around the
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.320]   jail and just listen to them and listen to their stories, but not talk too much because I was
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.360]   afraid if they heard my New England accent, they'd think I went to Harvard and crucify me at dawn.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.080]   So I went around and I started out with the professionals who were at the bottom of the list.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.640]   I liked them the least. They were people who felt that they had to be in jail for a certain
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.240]   amount of time. That was part of their lot. You know, that's how they learned how to stay out of
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.080]   jail by being in jail because they learned more about the process of law. And so they were working
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.160]   on their cases and they had pictures of their wives and children by them. And anytime I'd come
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.400]   close to them, they'd sort of quiet down and not talk anymore. They had no interest in talking
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.760]   about their cases to me. Now at the top of the list, the poets and madmen, there are about three
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.960]   of them. One was a Mexican. They'd like to steal police cars and police planes. That was a favorite
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.520]   thing he liked to do. And he had stolen a police plane and he'd had a ball. I could tell, by the
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.160]   way, he was smiling so much when he told me. And six police planes chased him going, "Land that
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:13.760]   plane. Land that plane." >> Herdy Gerdy,
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.200]   a barrel organ or similar instrument played by turning a crank.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.800]   One.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:45.280]   She had grown up in Westfield, New Jersey, in a fairly normal family situation. And she married
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.240]   and had three children. And come the '60s, she and her husband decided to experiment a little
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.880]   bit with the idea of free love. And the marriage came apart and the husband ended up with the three
[00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.760]   children. And she started out across to the Aleutian Islands where she was living with six
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.040]   men. And they would take LSD, window pain acid, and go out in a rowboat at night with different
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.200]   fantasies. For instance, they were going to the Bermuda Triangle. That was one of them that they
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.520]   would work out at night. And they'd pretend that they were rowing to the Bermuda Triangle. And there
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.440]   was this incredible phosphorescence she told me about. And I said, "Oh, God." She said, "You can't
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.320]   imagine the phosphorescence on LSD." I said, "Oh, boy, I can't." She said, "No, you can't."
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:45.600]   Setting. The surroundings or environment of anything. Two. So after a while, a commune broke
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.360]   up and the six men went off and started a pea farm in Hawaii. And so she was on her own. She bought
[00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.280]   herself a teepee up there in the North American Northwest and decided she would head to Santa
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.320]   Cruz to set it up. And she couldn't find a place that had the good vibes in Santa Cruz, so she was
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.440]   staying with some biker women. And one of the women's name was Bernice. And Bernice was very,
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.280]   very, very nervous. And when she would get nervous, she would walk in crosses and X's on the floor,
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.920]   you know, very angular. And so Caldonia decided that she should change her name. And she changed
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.560]   Bernice's name to Anka, like the figure eight or earth symbol. So every time Bernice got angry,
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.440]   she could think on her name Anka and walk in figure eights instead of X's. Now, the way
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.720]   Caldonia got her name was that her brother was involved in a hit and run accident in Santa Cruz.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.160]   And he decided he had to change his name. And he walked out, he picked up the Santa Cruz newspaper,
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.720]   and he saw the coldest town in the United States that day was Eli, Montana. So he changed his name
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.320]   to Eli Shivers. And Caldonia decided to explore her male energy and change her name to Elmer Shivers.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.440]   So there was brother and sister Eli and Elmer Shivers until Eli died of an overdose of heroin.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.240]   And so Elmer had to change her name back and was up dancing in the Santa Cruz hills
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.880]   and heard B.B. King playing "Oh, Caldonia." And she knew that was the name. It came to her
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:13.520]   as a chosen thing. Now, about this time, she was getting very lonely and wanted more children. So
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.520]   she decided to have a love child. And she met this man and she got pregnant in five days. At the end
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.160]   of five days, he came back and said, "Hey, do you know that Taj Mahal's wife has to ask him
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.120]   permission anytime she wants to speak to another man?" And he said, "I think that's cool." And she
[00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   threw him out. So she was pregnant with her love child. And he--
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:56.960]   friend. One attached to another by feelings of personal regard. Two.
[00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:04.640]   She threw him out and he went to live with another woman who had a small baby. And now this man
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.440]   was very, very hot-tempered. And the baby would cry a lot and he couldn't stand the crying. And
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.600]   finally, he flew off the handle, grabbed the baby and threw it out the door in the night. Now, he
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.920]   claimed he didn't know the tree was there. The baby hit the tree and was killed and he was put in
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:25.200]   prison in 1976. He was just getting out of prison and he had full intentions to go to India to learn
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.000]   to meditate so that he could calm himself down and wouldn't do this anymore, like throwing babies out
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.920]   the door, you see. So he went to India. Now, Caldonia had her love child at last and named it Peace
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:47.760]   Baba Aquarius. Now, when I hit San Francisco, I just thought it was another city and I wanted to go
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.440]   down to Santa Cruz. And everyone said, "That's just a beach coma town." I said, "Well, I'll go down and
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.240]   look at it and look at the beach comas. I'll be right back." I got down there and I was just
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:04.400]   outside the Pergolesi and out came Peace and he seduced me in no time. And Caldonia came over and
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.960]   said, "Come on, Peace. It's time to go home." And he said, "Isn't someone going with us?" And she said,
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.400]   "Looks like Peace wants you to come with us. Do you want to come?" I said, "Sure, why not?" She said,
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.680]   "Well, I'm staying with some biker women because I haven't found a place yet to pitch my teepee,
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:22.480]   but come on over and smoke a joint with us." Now, I don't smoke much. I have very weak
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:29.760]   ego boundaries and they tend to collapse very quickly. And so I decided I would, you know,
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.200]   try it and I was afraid they'd see that I looked like, acted like a five-year-old boy. So I decided
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:38.240]   after I smoked, since I was feeling like a five-year-old boy, that I would relate only
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.320]   to Peace Bob Aquarius. And I would put all my attention on him and I would indulge him,
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.240]   anything he wanted. And we started with an exercise where I lift him up on a pillow
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.640]   and drop him like a flying carpet, you know, and he'd say, "Do it again." So I decided I'd do it.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:03.840]   Time clock. A clock with an attachment by which a record may be made of the time of something
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.560]   as of the arrival and departure of employees. One and a half.
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:16.080]   I've been reading Indian philosophy, you know, because we were going to go to India and I was
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.360]   reading Zimmer's book and I thought, I was really excited about going to India because I thought,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:24.160]   "Oh, gee, well, certainly I'm going to get enlightened," you know. And so now it wasn't
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   my choice to go to India. I was going with a performance group to do Brex Mother Courage.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   I don't know why. We had gotten a John D. Rockefeller III travel grant to do this. That
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.080]   paid for our tickets over. And then different theaters were going to host us over there. So
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.720]   when we had to go to Amsterdam first and then fly Air India from Amsterdam. And in Amsterdam,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.520]   we all went out to celebrate and we went to one of these Amsterdam restaurants and we just assumed
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:55.520]   the wine on the table was the house wine. You know, we all drank it and they brought more.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.200]   And it turned out that each bottle was the most expensive wine you could buy on the table. It was
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:04.800]   about $25, you see. So the wine, just the wine list, the bill was about $200, much more than the
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.280]   food. And then the next day we headed out right away about that 16-hour flight on Air India. I
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.320]   was very nervous to be flying on Air India and didn't sleep at all. In fact, the cockpit was
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.640]   open. You could wander in and out. And we walked in just as the sun was coming up and they were
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:23.040]   pasting a comic strip all over the window. And so the whole windows were covered with Indian
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.440]   newspaper. I said, what are you doing? He said, well, we're flying directly into the sun. You
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.000]   know, we had to cover it. Now we're on automatic pilot. So as we were on automatic pilot, I ran
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.160]   back and looked out my window and saw that we were coming in over Calcutta and I looked down.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:50.880]   Drown to be suffocated by immersion in water or other liquid. 45.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.840]   So we got out in the middle of the Indian Ocean and this one guy kept jumping in and swimming.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:03.120]   And he didn't speak any English. I didn't speak any Hindu. And he was waving to me. And it looked
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:08.320]   like pea soup to me. I didn't want to go in. I kept saying, aren't there any? Like this,
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:12.000]   you know. And he'd laugh and shake his head. So I'd jump in, hop out, jump in, hop out,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.960]   jump in, hop out like that real fast just to show that I was a man. Now I was just wearing my ocean
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.280]   briefs. That's all I had. I brought a bottle of palm wine for them. And as soon it came time for
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:27.840]   them to pull in all the fish, you see. And one of the first fish that came in was this small shark.
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:33.440]   And he threw it at me. And the shark was giving babies. The shark was giving birth. And little
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:49.680]   baby sharks. Stalingrad. A city in the Southeast Soviet Union in Europe on the Volga. The scene
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:57.920]   of a bitter fighting in World War II, September 1942 through February 1943. Population 525,000,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:05.040]   estimated 1956. I decided when I got back from India I should go visit my father.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:14.560]   Just to check in, my father and my stepmother, they live in a very modern house with a heated
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:19.680]   swimming pool and a tennis court out front. And when I arrived, they didn't ask me any
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:23.200]   questions about India at all. In fact, they treated me as though I'd just come in from down the road.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.840]   And we started out with, very politely, with cocktail hours that began about five o'clock
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:33.200]   with Zoom. And then the six o'clock news, seven, six thirty news, seven o'clock news. And we were
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:38.560]   usually eating by the time the Odd Couple came on. And then the lights went out on automatic at nine
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:42.080]   o'clock. So if you weren't in your bed, you wouldn't find your way to it. You'd be lucky.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.720]   So I thought, I'm going to show the best slides of India after dinner. You know, I'm determined to.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:53.920]   And I got out and I had one of those enforced slideshows. And they, not a word. And so I thought,
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.200]   the next day, I thought, I'm going to show them to my grandmother, Gray. She was 90 years old.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:02.080]   I went over to her house, over to her apartment. I showed them. She said, "You don't mean it.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:08.080]   You were there? Oh, my ginks. Oh, come on." And that's all I needed. And I left Rhode Island.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.680]   Now, after I left Rhode Island, you see, I wanted to go across country. And I didn't have
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.200]   enough money to do it. Now, I had this fantasy idea that I thought every great actor should both
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.320]   play Hamlet in his lifetime and also fuck on stage. You know, should run the gamut, you know,
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.160]   or else try to incorporate both in Hamlet. But Hamlet wasn't playing this summer. I didn't know
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:34.320]   about any auditions for it. So I ended up, to try to make money, I ended up applying for a
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:40.480]   pornographic movie. And I got the role. I was really surprised. Now, there were three of us.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:45.840]   We were working as a team. There was myself, another man, and a woman. And one thing about
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.560]   this man, I have to tell you, was that he was working in the porn films because he wanted to
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.720]   leave New York City. And in order to leave New York City, he felt he had to go through psychoanalysis.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.920]   So he was paying for psychoanalysis by making pornographic movies.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.680]   Palette, the roof of the mouth consisting of bone, hard palette, in front, and of a
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.480]   fleshy structure, soft palette, at the back. One.
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:27.280]   In Calcutta, one of the Indian newspapers in Bengali, they printed in the headlines in Bengali,
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.560]   they said American actors change clothes in public. Now, we were. We were changing in our
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.240]   little green room, which is over to the side. We didn't have a dressing room. We did the same
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:42.480]   in New York. It was nothing special. And so all of these marawaris, these big 200, 300 pound Indian
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:46.320]   men, because they eat a lot of Bengali sweets there in Calcutta, these upper middle class,
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.360]   they came and they stood to watch us change. So we had to put towels around the women, you know,
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.920]   and put blankets up. And all the wives were down at one end of the room. Now, in Mother Courage,
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:00.080]   Yvette, the woman who was playing Yvette, would do a simulated blow job. This wasn't written in
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:04.640]   the script. This was added by the director. And she would be down on her knees, and she would put
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.160]   a coat of the soldiers over her head, and she'd bop like this with her head. It looked like she
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.000]   was sucking them. And then she had milk in her mouth at the end, and she'd spit it into a barrel,
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.560]   a big, big shot of milk, you know. And all the men would be standing around watching this,
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.000]   and all the women would be looking off like...
[00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:31.280]   Metaphysics. That branch of philosophy which treats of first principles,
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.800]   including the sciences of being, ontology, and of the origin and structure of the universe,
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.560]   cosmology, it is always intricately connected with the theory of knowledge, epistemology.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:51.360]   Four. So I did, I started to get, and I'm embarrassed, I was embarrassed about this,
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.760]   I started to get sexually obsessed. I felt it was very adolescent, but I thought I had to go through
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.680]   it. I couldn't figure out why it was happening to me in India, you know. And then I began to think
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:03.040]   it must have to do something with the fact that there were so many people, and I knew they were
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.800]   doing it, but I couldn't tell how and aware, you know. There was no indication. It was something
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:12.400]   like living in a very over-populated New England, you know, where all the people were. And so I was
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.160]   looking, I got interested in tantric, searching for tantric sexual masters, and I got an introduction
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:22.720]   to the most famous one, Gopi Krishna, up in Srinagar, Kashmir, and I got up there and it
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.880]   turned out that he was in Pennsylvania for the year. So from there I went down to Pune because
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:36.480]   everyone said Sri Bhagwan Rajneesh ran the wildest, the wildest orgy ashram around, and they were
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:40.720]   afraid to even look in the gates. So I got up there early, I checked into the Ritz Hotel,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:44.720]   this little Indian hotel, and I got down there in the morning, it was still dark, I knocked on the
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:49.520]   big gate, the gatekeeper opened it up, he was an Indian man, he had a copy of People magazine and
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.400]   a bottle of red wine, he'd been up all night, and he said, "You go around to the back and you
[00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:58.480]   sit down in the cement pavilion. As the sun comes up, you'll hear the meditation music." And I went
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.720]   and I sat down and the sun came up. Indeed, this quadraphonic sound came on full blast with a
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:08.080]   combination of Indian music and raga rock, I would call it, something like disco and Indian, very
[00:16:08.080 --> 00:16:12.960]   highly orchestrated and very well produced. And out of the bushes came all these people in orange,
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.520]   out of these little houses, women in long orange sleep robes, men in orange pajamas, and they were
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.680]   all wearing these orange sleep masks on their foreheads, you know, something like in New York,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.880]   you have the black ones, but these were orange, and when they get out there, they pull them down,
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:30.640]   and they started to shake all over, shaking and quaking, because the Guru's idea was to dynamically
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   loosen the Kundalini, which is this incredible energy that we all have in the base of our spine
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.800]   here, it's like a coil serpent, and if you can loosen it, it will go up through and open up all
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.400]   the chakras, so you won't just be stuck in the lower part of your body and not just be laying
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:46.080]   that around by your genitals, but it will move up into your heart, and if you're lucky, your throat
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.720]   and into your head, and then out the top of your head, and you'll be, you know, you'll be connected
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:55.440]   way, way high, high up and way low down, you know, and you'll be really connected, so this was he was
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:00.160]   working on in a very kind of new radical way by just having people jiggle so much that it would
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:05.520]   take this serpent loose, and so I wasn't jiggling because I was watching them jiggle, I found it
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.920]   more interesting to watch them, I didn't put on the sleep mask, and then after the jiggling, we
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:15.840]   would go hear him speak on his front porch, and about 300 of us, and he would speak in English, and just
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.880]   talk in a kind of diatribe, he wouldn't take too many room tone pauses, even if an airplane flew over,
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:26.400]   but we had to be very neutrally centered, because we were told that any kind of perfumes or cut
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:33.200]   flowers may cause him to leave his body, and he had been doing that, so this particular day, someone
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.480]   was in there that smelled, and they said the guru cannot come out until whoever it is that's smelling
[00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:43.920]   leaves, and so no one got up and left, and so the guards, the henchmen, the assistants went out and
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.640]   sniffed the whole audience, and finally found the culprit, threw him out, and out came the guru,
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.040]   he was a combination of Loretta Young and Fulton Bishop J. Sheen, you know, in life is worth it, just
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.600]   robes flowing, very handsome, the perfect traditional guru with the full beard, and took his seat in
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.440]   this very leather Madison Avenue chair, and his assistants would decide, and then he would begin
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:10.720]   to talk, a lot of anecdotes and stories, and very religious talking, and then we would go out, and
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:15.200]   we'd start to shake again after the talking, and then when we weren't shaking, we could have the
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:22.080]   different encounter groups, like primal scream, deprivation in therapy, encounter groups, now I
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:26.640]   was hanging out with Sophie, a French mime from St. Louis, now the way that Sophie came there was,
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:33.040]   she was in San Francisco, and she hugged a woman, and she had an a cosmic experience from this,
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:36.720]   and she said to the woman, how can I find out more about this, this is overwhelming, you know,
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.560]   instead of staying there, she decided to analyze it, and so she, the woman said,
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:45.840]   go to Bhagwan in India, and she flew, Sophie flew from San Francisco.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:19:09.120]   Election, the selection of a person or persons for office by vote, one.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:14.240]   So after I was in there about four days, I decided I would write the jail commander a letter,
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:21.120]   attention jail commander, September 23rd, sir, comma, I would like to request that if I am not
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:26.240]   brought to court today, that I be released, I have been in jail for four days, because I did not give
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.160]   the arresting officer my name, the first time he asked, I know this was wrong, and feel that
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:37.680]   spending one night in jail is enough, I have not been given a charge slip, and I am not sure of
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:45.440]   what my bail is, Spalding Gray, Spalding Gray 3-E, I guess that was my cell block, and then I have an
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:51.520]   asterisk down here that says, may I make one phone call, all right, they finally, after four or five
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:54.960]   days, decided that they would let me make a phone call, and I went up to the office, and I called
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:20:00.720]   Richard Shachner, and the line was busy, and I said, oh, wait, wait, just one more please, and
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.040]   they were nice enough, they were like astronauts and football players, a combination of the two,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:11.120]   blonde hair, and oh, all right, make it quick, so I called Liz, and the line, there was no answer,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.400]   so back to, back to the cell, I went, and this time I...
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:26.240]   Vaginal. Pertaining to the vagina of a female mammal.
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.400]   Two.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:46.800]   They, so they said, here's what you've got to do, I want, as the woman comes through the door,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.680]   I want both of you to get erections like this, because we want a shot just of your two erections,
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.680]   and then zero in on her.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:21:04.080]   I said, how am I going to do that? Now, you're not supposed to ask them that, because, you know, real
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.040]   male porn stars are so narcissistic that they can get it up immediately. In fact, I was there when
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:15.600]   the star of this movie, I had to get it up for a model ship passing through the room. They just took
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.360]   it through, and he went up, on direction, on cue, but we weren't that way, and for people who were
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.960]   not like that, they had women called fluffers who were working their way up in the porn, and they
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.920]   wanted to be stars, and they would fluff the men on the sidelines, and then the men would come out.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:34.800]   Now, there were three of us. There was a woman, and a friend of hers, a man, and myself, and the man
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.560]   was doing these porn films because he wanted to leave New York City, and he was in psychoanalysis,
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.760]   and he wanted to pay through it for making the films. He hoped that he'd be cured. He'd move to
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.800]   Appalachia and get himself a motorcycle, so he was making the porn films. Now, we would, so she would
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.440]   work on us, she would work on me, say, with her mouth, and him with the hand, and then vice versa,
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:58.240]   and then as soon as I was up, I'd start down as he went up, and we would never, we would never
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:03.920]   get it together. So finally, he said, "Clear the room," you know, so the director would go out of the room,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:09.840]   and we'd work together, and we'd both get up, and he'd say, "All right, quick, bring the cameras back,"
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:16.080]   you know, and by the time the cameras set up, we'd be down again. So it was a lot of work,
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:22.960]   and we finally finished the shot. It took about all afternoon. The director was very
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:30.560]   upset and running around me, saying, "Make more noise, Grey. Make more faces."
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:40.960]   "Prerogative. An exclusive right or privilege attaching to an officer position
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:48.800]   as theoretically that of the sovereign. One and a half." So, Caldonia said goodbye, and before I,
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   she said, "Drive across the mother. Don't fly back. Get acquainted with a mother if you've never done it
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.000]   before. Drive across her, and before you go, I'm going to do your chart." So I got a car, a drive-away
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.640]   car from San Francisco. I was going to drive back to New York, and she did my chart. She and Peace
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.440]   were there, and she said, "Listen, the one thing I found out from your chart is whatever you do,
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:13.600]   get involved in working in institutions, because if you don't, you're going to end up in one," you know,
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.520]   and so I said, "Thanks a lot. Bye. Oh, don't say goodbye to Peace. He doesn't like goodbyes."
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:21.040]   I got in the car. Now, Paul Zimet told me, "If you're ever going across the country, you should
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.880]   stop and see Las Vegas. It's worth it if you only live once. All right, I'll give it a try." I decided
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:29.040]   I drove straight to Las Vegas from San Francisco. I was chain-smoking palm walls and eating Swiss
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.800]   cheese out of the package. You know, I didn't stop. By the time I came into Las Vegas, it was dark. I
[00:23:32.800 --> 00:23:37.600]   was just being guided in by the stars and that great island oasis of gleaming light up ahead.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.120]   I pull in. I go into the Chiefess Motel. I immediately, I get so excited. It's an electric
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.800]   bed. I can't believe it. I drop a quarter in the bed. I don't lie on it. I go in and take a shower.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.440]   I come out. I go past the vibrating bed, and I go to the biggest hotel right away. I go to the Sands,
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:53.840]   and I go in, and I start to, "Oh, this isn't for me." I think, "Oh, not at all. I saw it on it right
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.440]   away. What's Paul Zimet sending me to this place for? I'm going to go get something to eat." So,
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.080]   I went in. It was so expensive for a hamburger and a beer. I was so pissed off, I tore up the check,
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.200]   and I was walking down the street. I was looking all right. I was looking normal enough. I had a
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.800]   beer to write an Indian coat, silk coat and, oh, white pants and two police cars pulled up on
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.320]   either side. And they grabbed me and said, "What's your name, boy?" And I said, "Why? What do you
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:29.360]   ask?" And they said, "What's that?" Sciatic of the ischium or the back of the hip, i.e., the sciatic
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:44.080]   nerve to... So, Sophie and I would... We had our own little Kabbalah where we would hang out. We
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.640]   refused to take the orange. We were the only ones not wearing orange. We were wearing beige pajamas,
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:54.720]   and we would get together and talk down the guru or make fun of him. And we would drink whiskey
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.440]   while we did this, which was a very, very evil thing to do in India because we were always aware
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:04.000]   how much grain it took to make a small bottle of whiskey. And we would keep it in a brown paper
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.720]   bag because of this. And we would drink it, and then we'd make these plans, you know. And now,
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:13.680]   what her problem was, was that she had found out that the guru was talking down homosexuality.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:18.160]   And she had had this cosmic experience with a woman, and she considered herself gay.
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.360]   So, she didn't know what to do about that, and she better have an audience with him. So,
[00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.320]   she did have an audience with him, and she came back very depressed. She said, "I think I'm going
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:30.400]   to have to go back to San Francisco. The guru told me that it was just a fad. If everyone was gay
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:34.320]   tomorrow, I would be straight." That was his response. I said, "Now, wait a minute, wait a
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:39.760]   minute, Sophie. I'll go down, and I'll have an audience with him, and we'll compare notes before
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:44.000]   you fly back." So, I applied for an audience, and they told me not to wear any scented soaps or
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:48.960]   perfumes or don't wash my clothes in any scented soaps. So, I went down smelling very neutral,
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:53.600]   but I was not an orange, which meant I wasn't going to take the mala. And I went around to
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:57.520]   the back gate, and there were about six of us allowed in, and people sniffed us as we went
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:01.680]   through. We went around, and the guru came out and sat in his leather chair, and his shakti came
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.480]   out, his female counterpart, who was about 26 years old and from the United States, and there
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.920]   were people documenting it with flash cameras and tape recorders. And so, the first thing that
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.360]   happened was someone came and knelt by him. Now, we were told not to kneel too close because it
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:19.600]   could make him leave his body. And so, they were kneeling about where that wire was, and this woman
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.760]   said, "I'm looking for a boyfriend. I can't find a boyfriend." He said, "Well, what's wrong with
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:28.720]   you? You know, you're a very attractive, intelligent young woman. What's the problem?" She said, "Well,
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:32.960]   I'm in love with Peter." And he said, "Don't get involved with Peter. He's married. He's just
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:38.160]   bored." And he said, "Now, you go out, and you find yourself a man. And if you can't find one,
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:55.280]   come to me, because I have lists." "Dragon Odd," one of a series of persecutions of
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.680]   French Protestants under Louis XIV by dragoons quartered upon them.
[00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:08.880]   So, every morning, we got two meals a day. In the morning, we had to get up about 4.30. I think we
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.120]   went down to breakfast about 5. It was always very interesting for me because Las Vegas was still
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:17.840]   going full steam at 5 o'clock in the morning. And you had a beautiful view of it through the
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:23.200]   jail bars. And it was a kind of nice framed and distant way of seeing Las Vegas I never expected
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:28.560]   that I would have. And so, we would go down in line. They'd march us down. And when we got there,
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.960]   it was something like greasy eggs and grits. And then we'd go back up and walk around the
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.360]   floor smoking Bull Durham cigarettes or reading something from the prison library. And then the
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:42.000]   TV would come on around 6 o'clock with the news, which was usually reports about how bad this
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.240]   particular jail was that we were in, which they were trying to close down. And then after that,
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:50.160]   cop shows came on. And we listened to them full blast. Now, this particular morning,
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:55.920]   there was a new prisoner that came in. And he was in the line. And he jumped through the place
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:59.680]   where they put the trays. And he jumped back out again. I thought he was trying to make an escape.
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.640]   I couldn't believe that the guards didn't see him. And then we got back upstairs. He was in the
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.640]   corner, you know, rubbing this thing that he had picked up in the kitchen. I don't know what it was.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.920]   And I thought he was a needle. I thought he was fixing to shoot up. I was just going to be a fly
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:16.800]   on the wall, you see. And he got this thing real rubbed in the cement. And then I saw him walk over
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.840]   to the door. And I realized he was holding a coat hanger, half a coat hanger, that he had sharpened
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:26.320]   on the cement to a terrific point. And he called the guards. And two guards came. And while the
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.160]   guards were coming, he took off all his clothes. And just as he was standing there naked, just as
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:35.680]   they got to the door, the guards went, he went like this. And jabbed it right into his liver,
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.320]   you know. And this blood started coming out. And he was a black man. I'd never seen a black man
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.880]   bleed before. And I was amazed at how much darker the blood was, how much more purple it was. And I
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.280]   was watching this. And I remember it very vividly. And the guards came and took him away. And the
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.000]   guards came back. And the prisoner said, did he die? And they say, not yet, but he better. This
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.520]   is the second time he's done it, the fucker. And then, of course, the prisoners all go,
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:02.080]   you fucking assholes, you fucking shits. And see, the guards just smiled back, you see,
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.200]   because the guards, they were like a combination of astronauts and football players. They were very
[00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:13.360]   nice. They had us by the balls, you see. They didn't care. And you could yell all you wanted,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.880]   you see. And so TV would go on at six o'clock. And this particular night, I went down. And one
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.240]   of the professionals said, anyone want my carrots? I said, oh, sure. Yeah, over here. I mean, oh,
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:31.760]   yeah, I mean, oh, yeah, I mean, I'll take them. And I realized I had shown too much enthusiasm,
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:35.760]   too much life. I could tell by the way he scraped the carrots on the plate, I was going to pay for
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:41.360]   it. We got back up to the cell. And I was lying. I had an upper bunk. And all of a sudden, this
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:45.840]   smoke and these cinders started coming up around me, flaming cinders, you know, and stuff burning.
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:50.080]   And I looked down. And here were these two guys, one, the professional with the carrots,
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:54.480]   under the bunk underneath cooking white bread, making toast. They were cooking it
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:30:06.960]   with toilet paper, burning under the bunk. >> Bargain. An agreement between parties
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.440]   settling what each shall give and take will perform and receive in a transaction.
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:18.560]   30. >> So when I got to India,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:23.600]   I realized that I didn't make the choice. And someone wanted to give me some hashish. And I
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:27.280]   smoked the hashish. And it completely ruined me. I didn't know where I was. And they were having
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.280]   a meeting downstairs, the theater company, to determine what cities we would go to,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.040]   how much time we'd spend in each, and how much time we'd have in between traveling.
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.880]   And I couldn't make any choices at all. Because I was so completely stoned, I couldn't make any
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.200]   decisions. And from that day out, I had the feeling that the entire trip was run by someone
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.200]   else. >>
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:59.360]   Sting, to prick a wound with some sharp-pointed, often venom-bearing organ with which certain
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:14.640]   animals are furnished, i.e. to be stung by a bee. One. >> And so they threw this little shark at me.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.000]   And the little sharks were coming out of it and giving birth. And it landed at my feet. And then
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.520]   we started in. After they got all the fish in, they brought it in with a beautiful work chant.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:28.400]   They were all just chanting. And the nets came in in no time. And the boat was flopping with fish.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:32.640]   And we started in. I smelled smoke. And I turned around. And I saw they had this driftwood fire
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.440]   going on the boat. And they were turning the fish over the fire, just like this, slightly,
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.760]   just like marshmallows on an open campfire, and just charring the outside of the fish. And then
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:45.680]   they'd toss it at my feet like this. That was on the bow of the boat. And I'd eat it. And I'd eat
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:50.720]   this shark just like an ear of corn. I had never tasted anything so fresh or so delicious. When we
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.640]   got on shore, they started loading up my basket with all sorts of fish to take home. They were
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.560]   smiling and beaming. And we were taking some photographs of them and saying that we would
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.120]   send them to them. Now, I got back to the house. And I couldn't stand it. I was bored. The fishing
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.360]   trip was the most exciting part. The rest of the time, it was just warm water, palm trees,
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:19.920]   and a little... >> Dowry. The money, goods, or estate which a woman brings to her husband at marriage?
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:30.560]   >> Three. >> When we started playing in New Delhi, that's where we first started playing Mother
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.800]   Courage, all of the Indians knew Brecht very well. I don't know why. I guess their affiliation with
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:40.400]   Russia. And so there was no problem with that. But we had a break, a dinner break, where here
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:46.240]   in New York, we'd serve soup and fruit and cheese. There, they were serving kebabs and warm orange
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:51.280]   cruch and warm Coca-Cola. Now, they didn't have any bottle opus in India. That was one of the
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:57.520]   things that was missing. And so at the intermission, they would open their Coke on the set. And because
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:01.760]   it was warm, it would spray everywhere. So we would spend the rest of the play sticking to the floor
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:09.680]   on this sugary Coke. So then we played in Calcutta. Now, in Calcutta, we were put up in different
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:15.760]   houses. And I was put up with some Marawari art dealers, these big Bengali, they would eat the
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.680]   Bengali sweets. They had a mansion. They had two mansions right next to each other. The brother,
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:24.160]   the two brothers, they each had a house. And they treated me like I was one of the objects that they
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.160]   were collecting, I think, because they put me in the servants' quarters and they never let me come
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.400]   into the house. They kind of head me off with the house and say, "May I help you?" You know? So what,
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:36.000]   now, I had a chauffeur. I had a chauffeur that would take me in in the morning because I was
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.760]   outside of town. And then when I couldn't get a cab coming back, I would never take one of the
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:44.320]   rickshaws because in Calcutta, it was one place where the rickshaw drivers still ran barefoot.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.600]   All the others were mechanized bicycle rickshaws. And these guys were about 90 pounds and they were
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.720]   would run on 110-degree pavement. And I guess they did this because the cells to your feet grow back
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:59.840]   and shoes wear out, you know? So it was a good economical way. But I was weighing then about
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:05.200]   150 pounds or lower and I wouldn't get in one. Every time I got in one, I felt like this gross,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:11.760]   gross pig giant, you know, white pig. And so I would say, "Away. No, no, no. But we want the money.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:15.520]   They want the money. No, get away." I was brushing them away like flies. "I want a taxi cab. I live
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:20.480]   five miles out of town. I'm not going to have you run me five miles out of town." And so this one
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:24.160]   day, one morning, I woke up and my chauffeur didn't come and I was afraid to go in the house. I was
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:28.800]   intimidated by the way they treated me. So I decided I'll walk in. I walked in. The guy wasn't
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:33.200]   there. I walked right upstairs to the master bedroom and there he was lying on the floor like
[00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:38.880]   a beached whale, about 250 pounds, covered with baby powder. And these two 90-pound Indian men,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.480]   well, they're all Indians. He was Indian too. They're going like this on him, right? They're
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:48.240]   giving him a massage. And he says, "May I help you?" And now the Indian men, the servants,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:52.960]   are from the south. They go see their families about twice a year and they spend all the rest
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:57.440]   of the time up there working for this man for very low wages and sending the money back. Then when
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:03.520]   they're very old, they get a chance to be sent back to their homes to die with a slight pension.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:10.400]   So he sent for my chauffeur and I got in town. Now we were playing at this one theater and for
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:14.400]   these Marawaris, mainly upper middle class Indians, but the director was allowing,
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:20.000]   he was allowing the street urchins to come in, like the untouchables. And now these people had
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.680]   never been in a room with untouchables or street urchins before. So this was causing
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:43.760]   lucrative, profitable, remunerative, a lucrative business. So at last I made enough to take a bus
[00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.960]   across the country and I couldn't make up my mind between the Greyhound and the American Gypsy.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:53.600]   And I went up to 34th Street to take a look at the American Gypsy. I took one look in and I thought,
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:56.720]   "No, I can't get on this." I thought, "I'd better get on." "No, I can't." "Oh, I don't know." "All
[00:35:56.720 --> 00:36:02.000]   right, I'll get on." And I got on and I had to lie down because it was just mattresses, you know.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.760]   And I, because I was suffering from hypoglycemia, I was carrying all my own cheese and nuts, you
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:11.760]   know. I was squirreling them. I had them hidden away. Now we started out and first thing that
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.840]   everyone passes around, a joint. And I saw how quickly that joint went. So I started hiding my
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:20.800]   cheese and nuts. I had a little puff. I was, no, I didn't come back to the owner. I was in the back
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:26.080]   with two women, two gals from Helsinki and an Australian woman gym teacher. And we were sleeping
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:31.120]   head to toe, you know, like sardines. And so here's how I would eat my nuts. I would just go
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.800]   like this, you know, and chew it all.
[00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:54.720]   Sherwood Forest, an ancient royal forest in central England,
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:58.000]   chiefly in Nottinghamshire, the traditional haunt of Robin Hood.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:05.120]   Two. So we were exhausted from playing in these different Indian cities. And we decided we would
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.680]   go up because it was so hot up into the Himalayas and see what that was like. And actually I was
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:13.760]   more pleased with that because it reminded me of the American northwest. I was less homesick.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.920]   The only problem was I realized I had lost my will, which really frightened me. And all I had
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:23.600]   was this vision when in my, in front of me of this California redwood falling like, but never
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:29.840]   hitting. So it would start again, but never hitting the ground. And when I wasn't seeing that falling
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.000]   in my mind's eye, I'd be out walking and I'd walk and walk. And these old Kashmiri men would come
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.760]   out of the hills, you know, like from Grimm's Fairy Tale. They had like a little yarmulke and
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:41.280]   they were very tall and they'd shake my hand and smile. And then they'd walk beside me. They
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:45.200]   wouldn't say anything. And I'd walk and walk. And when I wasn't walking, we would have a little tea
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:50.400]   and we would, the only book we had to read was Virginia Woolf to the Lighthouse, which was just
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:54.880]   so poignant and all about loss and was getting me and reminding me of the English countryside and
[00:37:54.880 --> 00:38:00.240]   making me all the more homesick. Now someone, someone told me that they had given me some
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.240]   organic mescaline here in New York and said India would be a good place to take it. When I got to
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:09.200]   India, I thought it would be absolutely the wrong place to take it. Any kind of mescaline, organic,
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:14.000]   synthetic, any kind of drug. In fact, the one thing I didn't understand was how people could
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.360]   be stoned over. The American hippies could be stoned. I couldn't believe it. A German or Dutch
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.240]   every day was like being stoned for me just dealing with that culture. And so I was being real
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:27.280]   straight. But when I got up there to the, up there to Kashmir, it reminded me enough of the American
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:33.520]   Northwest to get nostalgia and say, all right, we'll try the mescaline now. So I divided it in
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:38.560]   half and I gave half to Liz and I took half. And we had it just before lunch. And the lunch was very
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.960]   big. We'd have Indian cooking in the day. So evidently it's absorbed. It didn't come on. I
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:46.880]   thought it was a dud. We went down and sat by a stream. Nothing happened. She said, all right,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:51.120]   I'm going to go back and read to the lighthouse. I said, well, I'm going to, I'm going to go for
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:56.640]   my walk, you know. And I start walking down the road and I see all of these Kashmiri schoolboys.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.920]   And this is not an hallucination. I see these, I see all of these.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:14.640]   Porridge, chiefly British. A food made of oatmeal or some other meal or cereal
[00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:19.600]   boiled to a thick consistency in water or milk. One.
[00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:26.560]   I see these Kashmiri schoolboys coming at me dressed in blue and they start waving
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:32.080]   and I wave back and my waves turn into a kind of signal, a pinafore like this. I begin to improvise
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.680]   a wave, you know, and like this. And they begin to do this back. And I see this one boy coming at me
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.080]   like this and he has to be a prodigy of the town. He's coming at me and I think he's going to run
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.240]   right into me. And as soon as he gets to me, he goes like this and he begins to set up. He's about
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:50.720]   11 years old. He begins to set up a weight exchange where we're dancing, but we're not touching. And I
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:54.720]   don't know who is initiating it. And right in the middle of this dance and all of them are around us,
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:59.520]   the other children and some of the fathers, the mescaline comes on full blast. And I start getting
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:05.040]   so high, I cannot believe it. And I am sure that some authority figure is going to go, "Gray,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:15.520]   come with us. You're crazy." And no one did that. And I kept getting higher and higher and I didn't
[00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:26.400]   think, I couldn't stand to get any higher. It really scared me. So I broke deficient,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:40.720]   lacking some element or characteristic, defective, one and a half.
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:46.080]   So at last I was going to this psychiatrist. He was one of those that didn't say anything.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:53.040]   He would just fix his face in a kind of mask and stare at me. Now, for instance, if he had a book
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.560]   on his desk, by mistake, he might have a book on his desk. I wanted to see what the title was and
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:06.400]   I'd just kind of look at it as I came in. He'd take the book and go. I guess he wanted me to
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:12.160]   get angry. I don't know. So I sat down and I found that I was talking, you know, I was talking a lot.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:17.920]   He had me on tranquilizers. And one of the side effects of the tranquilizers is that my semen dried
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:26.880]   up. But he didn't tell me ahead of time. So I started talking to him a lot and I'm telling
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:32.000]   him stories. And I guess I was trying to make him laugh. So I told him this story. I said, you know,
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.680]   when my brother was about 14, he hid under my father's bed. My father, he's not a superstitious
[00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:42.960]   man at all. He's very materialistic. And every night he comes and puts his slippets right by
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.880]   the bed very evenly. And my brother happened to be hiding under the bed. And that night, for some
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:50.480]   reason, he reached out and took one of my father's slippers and threw it straight up in the air.
[00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:55.120]   My father yelled for my mother, Betty, come quick, come quick. My slippers are flying.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:03.360]   My slippers are flying. And my therapist laughed.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.560]   Americanism. Devotion to or preference for the United States and its institutions.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:32.560]   The one of the top of the list, the second poet and madman, he was a black man. Now the blacks
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:40.000]   slept all day in the cell. They put their sheets up from the top bunk and then just be behind them.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.600]   They take the only sheet we had on the bed off and put it up. And then they'd have their privacy
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:47.840]   and they'd be sleeping all day. And then at night, because the lights never went off, they'd do
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:56.000]   pushups, poker, play poker for pushups. There were no poker chips. So you'd pay 20 pushups for a card
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:03.360]   or whatever. And so they were all in great shape. And the whites were pretty slovenly and just
[00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:11.040]   really falling apart. They'd just kind of hang around, hang out. And so there's this one black guy
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:15.040]   who I put in the top category of the poets and madmen who would sleep under this blanket
[00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:19.440]   all day with it over his head. He didn't, because he was on a top bunk, he couldn't hang a sheet.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:23.360]   And around cocktail hour, or we didn't have cocktails there, what would be cocktail hour if
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:29.120]   I weren't there, he would throw the blanket off and go, "Do you want to know how I got here? I'll
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:34.000]   tell you how I got here." And go into this long two, three minute diatribe. And then he'd cover
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:39.600]   himself up again with a blanket and just was silent the rest of the time. The other guy was
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:44.480]   about 18 years old. He was a white guy and he was a con man. He was learning how to be a con man.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:50.160]   Like what he did was he would make his own credit cards from the copy of a credit card he'd get out
[00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:54.000]   of the trash behind a restaurant. And so no one knew they were missing their credit card because
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.960]   he'd just make false ones, you see, and buy all the stereo equipment. He'd also made a box that
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:03.920]   crossed telephone wires so you could call China for fun. He would do that. And in other words,
[00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:08.880]   he was a con man, but he was also a trickster, like one of their deals. In order to have a party,
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:13.680]   he was traveling with a male friend and a sister. And he and a boyfriend would hang out. The sister
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:19.360]   would go into one of the casinos early and warm up to one of the owners. And then the owner had
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.640]   the hots for the sister. And then the brother would come in and go, "Hey, sis. Oh, wow. We
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:26.320]   haven't seen each other for five years." And they'd have this big kissing, crying reunion.
[00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:30.480]   And the owner would say, "Hey, we got to have a party." And he'd get out the champagne and the
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:37.360]   shrimp dip, just little things like that. See, he had been busted. He had been busted for being in
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.320]   a casino under age. And we became friends. He used to tell me his dreams. And he would also
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:47.440]   write rock and roll songs that he would recite to me. So I decided that what I was going to do
[00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:54.080]   was have him smuggle out a note, because it looked like I wasn't going to get out. My bail was $285.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:45:00.080]   And no one knew where I was. So I said, "You've got to contact New York. Tell Liz to send $285
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:12.400]   down to a bondsman." So he did. He got out and said, "Send it to me."
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:19.120]   Cock-eyed. Slang. Twisted or slanted to one side. Foolish or absurd.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:30.800]   One.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:42.640]   So then this hippie came up to him. I call him a hippie because he was a French guy with dreadlocks.
[00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.880]   He looked like a classical French hippie. And he came up in his orange road, and he knelt,
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:52.240]   and he said, "I'm feeling all this incredible energy." And Bhagwan said, "Show it to me,
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:57.040]   but don't get too close. Stay back here." And so this guy began to shake all over like a
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:03.600]   Reichean dream. I have never seen anyone shake like this. His jaw was like this. And Bhagwan
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:08.960]   pulled back, and he called the woman over and said, "Put your hand on his head." And she put
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.600]   her hand on the dreadlocks and bring him back. And he did. He calmed down, and he said to the woman,
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:17.760]   "You see? What do you mean you can't find a boyfriend?"
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:31.840]   Edge. The border or part adjacent to a line of division,
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:38.000]   a brim or margin, i.e. the horizon's edge or the edge of a precipice.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:49.520]   Five. And he said, "Gray, come with me." But no one did it, and I kept getting higher and higher.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:53.040]   So I decided I would pull out of it myself, and I pulled out of it and just burst through the
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:57.200]   crowd of kids and started walking. Some of them followed me for a way, but mainly the fathers did,
[00:46:57.200 --> 00:47:01.360]   and pretty soon I was ending up maybe with just one or two fathers after a five-mile walk beside
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:05.120]   me, not speaking at all, just walking. And then I would turn around, and each time I would turn
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:08.640]   around and come back through the town, all the children would come out doing jumping jacks and
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:13.360]   doing pinafore signals and chasing me through the street. And Liz said, "I think you've found your
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:20.400]   place. You're the happiest I've ever seen you here. I don't see why you should go on or even
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.040]   go back to New York City." But in that day, I met the school teacher. That next night, I met the
[00:47:25.040 --> 00:47:29.760]   school teacher to turn in the road. This is more coincidence. And he said, "Why don't you come stay
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.200]   in my mud house? It's very small. The whole family's living there, but you could stay with us
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:41.280]   and come to the school and do jumping jacks there." So I was thinking of doing that, but there was no
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:46.000]   way we could stop, you see. I couldn't stop because we were looking for Shangri-La. And we had heard
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:52.400]   that Shangri-La was called Little Tibet. It was Ladakh, which used to be a part of Tibet, was
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:56.720]   seceded before the Chinese came. So now it was a part of India, and it was way up in the Himalayas,
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:48:00.480]   and it was supposed to be the most and most perfect beautiful place left in the world because
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:04.640]   there was no tourism or there just was tourism for the past two years, and it was very difficult to
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:08.640]   get the lay. So you had to take a jeep, right? And it took two days, and you had to get a driver
[00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:12.880]   and rent a jeep. So four of us rented this jeep, and we started up. After the first day,
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:18.000]   the jeep broke down. I was totally panicked. How's this guy going to fix it? He had to hitchhike back
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:21.680]   to the closest town. He didn't know how long it would take, and he took us over to an adobe
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.440]   house that looked something like an American Indian mud house in the southwest. And he said,
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:29.840]   "You can stay here." Evidently, he knew the people, or they decided to take us in. So we were there,
[00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.600]   and we looked through this crack in the wall. It was just mud walls. And here were these two women
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.280]   that were over a little fire made with sticks. They looked like witches. They were stirring a pot,
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:41.520]   you know? And they looked like the house had been built around them. There was no door, like a
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:46.320]   bottle in the ship, you know? They were just in there cooking. And I assume that was the mother
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:51.200]   and the sister and the brother. Of course, he was a boy, a man, so he had been sent to school down in
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:57.120]   the lowlands, and he spoke English. And I said, "What is it like in the winter here?" And he said,
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:02.080]   "The snow is this high. No one goes out. No one goes out of these mud rooms all winter."
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.920]   And I said, "Well, what about suicide?" And he said, "What's that?" And I said, "You know,
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:14.080]   like in Vermont in the winter, you know?" And he said, "We don't know about it." And then I went
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:20.080]   into this one little mud room. I went into this one little mud room, and it was a complete little
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.120]   Tibetan temple with all the chakras and the little pictures and the little mandalas and the bells and
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.120]   cushions to kneel on. The whole room was completely different than any of the other rooms. And I
[00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   thought, they must have a working religion, whatever that means. You know, something's going
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.760]   on in this little mud house because the only thing they had for a toilet was this hole about this big
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:43.440]   in the bottom of the house going down into the center of the earth. And if you want to have
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:47.680]   toilet anxiety, standing over that thing was unbelievable. You couldn't squat over it, you just
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:54.400]   had to stand. And so we finally went to bed. We had no idea what time it was. Bed was on the mud
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:59.440]   floor was this mat, and there was a knock on the door somewhere in the night, and the women came
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:05.760]   smiling to the door with this big bowl of rice and potatoes. So we ate that, went into semi-sleep,
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:11.680]   and the driver arrived around dawn. He hadn't slept at all. He was still bright, smiling all the time.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.320]   And he drove us on in the Jeep, and we got to the Capitol. Indeed, it was Shangri-La. I've never
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:21.040]   seen anything like it. The soldiers who were supposed to be guarding the border to Tibet
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:25.040]   were holding hands in the street and smiling. And there were no movie theaters. There was no
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.280]   prostitution. There were no bars. It was just a few Jeeps driving up and down this dusty road,
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.600]   like an old Western town, and all of the Ladakans were going, "Dule, dule," which means, I think,
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.240]   a combination of hello and goodbye all in one breath. And they're smiling, and I can't believe
[00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:47.280]   how happy they are, and I think, "I've got to get out of here." I've got to get back to New York,
[00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:52.160]   where I'm happy being unhappy, you know? Either I stay here and I learn the whole language and
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.080]   some kind of communication, or I've got to get out. But I couldn't leave right away because of
[00:50:56.080 --> 00:51:00.000]   how long it took to get there, you know? And we were so exhausted from the trip that I thought,
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:14.320]   "Well, in five or six days, we'll..." People. The whole body of persons constituting a community,
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:20.480]   a tribe, a race, or a nation, i.e., the people of England. Two.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:34.800]   The only loser, he was about, oh, I don't know how old he was, but he'd been in and out of jail
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   since he was 18. He was probably 26, and he was from New Hampshire. And he, you know, Las Vegas,
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.160]   Nevada is a totally outlaw state. In fact, I'm still wanted there for jumping bail. And they'll
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:53.920]   put you in for anything, hitchhiking, trespassing. And this guy was in because he was driving his
[00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:58.720]   truck through, and a cop stopped him. And he said he wished he had his gun, but he didn't that
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:02.640]   particular time. And the cops started beating up on him with a blackjack. And he said, "You son of
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.600]   a bitch, you hit me one more time with that, and I'm going to beat you up." And sure enough,
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:09.280]   he took it away and he started hitting the cop with it. So that's what he was in there for.
[00:52:09.280 --> 00:52:14.560]   And so he was the main loser and the most creative one because he had a pencil, and he was always
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:20.000]   doing a mural on this wall, a beautiful pencil mural of a covered bridge from New Hampshire,
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.480]   one of those New Hampshire covered bridges going over a stream. And then over the covered bridge
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:30.960]   was marching all of his possessions, you know, his motorcycle like this, his revolver, you know,
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:36.320]   his gun, his bazooka. He had a bazooka that he used to go down to Rye Beach in New Hampshire
[00:52:36.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   and shoot out into the ocean for fun. And all of these little things were going over there,
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:44.400]   and he would draw it. Now, I didn't know how long I was going to be in there for because I didn't
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:49.360]   give them my name. So they had me on what they called a John Doe clause, which meant that they
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:54.320]   could look for me for eight or nine years under the name of John Doe. And if I didn't give them
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:57.600]   name, then they could just keep me there indefinitely. So I was starting to get a little
[00:52:57.600 --> 00:53:04.640]   panicked. And every day they'd come down and say, "Jackson, roll it up. Schlesinger, roll it up.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.400]   Davis, roll it up. That meant you rolled up your bedding and get out." And I kept thinking they
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:14.800]   were going to do this for me. So finally, I did find out what my bail was, and I had this guy
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:26.560]   smuggle out a note. And he asked Liz to send it down to him, and she-- [DING]
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:37.280]   Erogynous. Arousing or tending to arouse sexual desire. One.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:58.160]   The other porn film was in a farm in Pennsylvania. It was shot at a farm. And they told me to come
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.880]   into this bedroom and to have this sex scene with a woman that I was not at all attracted to.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.800]   And I didn't know what to do about it. And this is when I knew I wasn't going to make it. And
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:14.800]   she said, "All right. Tell me what turns you on. I'll do it. Anything." I just was paralyzed. I
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:20.480]   didn't know what to do. And they said, "Get him out of here." And they brought on, instead of me,
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:26.240]   they brought on an ex-Los Angeles cop who was up there doing I don't know what. He had a CB radio.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.520]   And I heard this, "Wham!" And I turned around. He had belted the woman across the face and
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:45.760]   jumped on her.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:15.760]   [SOUND]
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:25.440]   Prime mover.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:34.880]   Mechanical. The initial agent which puts a machine in motion as wind, electricity, et cetera.
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:37.680]   One and a half.
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:49.360]   So I'd wake up every morning about six o'clock, and I'd begin to feel this incredible energy in
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:53.440]   the base of my spine. And I'd start rolling around on the floor. Now, the people whose
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:56.560]   loft I was staying in were very upset because they were trying to make a film,
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:00.800]   and they couldn't concentrate. And they said, "Please, please, we'll give you a list of numbers.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:04.960]   Please get some professional help. We can't have you rolling around on the floor." So they gave
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:09.280]   me lists of psychiatrists. This is New York's answer to Kundalini energy coming up. It was
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:13.520]   coming up in the wrong place, you see. And so I would call all these different psychiatrists,
[00:56:13.520 --> 00:56:17.200]   but none of them could see me because it was August and they were all on vacation. So I was
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:22.240]   just getting these tape recordings, you see. And so I would go back to rolling around on the floor.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:28.080]   At last, a psychiatrist in town, it was in town, recommended someone and said, "You should go to
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:33.760]   this man. He's good." I walked in. His place is on Central Park West. I walked in, and this
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:38.720]   psychiatrist told me, "Whatever you do, when you go to him, no matter what he costs, look at this
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:43.440]   as major surgery. And if you need the money, ask your father for it." So I went in, and this guy
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.800]   looked smart and young and handsome. I wished I was him when I saw him. I had that feeling.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:54.800]   First thing he said to me was, "Why haven't you had any children?"
[00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:00.400]   And the next thing he said was, "I think you're psychotic, and you have to come to me."
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:15.920]   Termite. Any of the pale-colored, soft-bodied, mainly tropical, social insects,
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:21.360]   constituting the order isoptera, some of which are very destructive to buildings,
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.680]   furniture, household stores, et cetera, a so-called white ant.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:34.880]   Three. So for some reason, Richard Schechner thought we should play Mother Courage in a mud
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.840]   village north of Calcutta, in a place that people had never seen Westerners before. Now,
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:45.280]   we could have been singing Christmas carols. It didn't matter. People walked for three days
[00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:51.440]   to see this. And we were rehearsing, so the village was there watching us. And then at night,
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:57.520]   when it came time to play it, we had the set very much like the garage here, but there was no room.
[00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.240]   It was a banyan tree. And we had all the pulleys on this banyan tree, and then this big pit dug
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:07.920]   down in the ground, in the earth, six feet deep. And we started off under a full moon. It was very
[00:58:07.920 --> 00:58:12.240]   beautiful. And there were about 3,000 people there. All the children were sitting cross-legged.
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:16.480]   The mothers said women were kneeling, and the men were standing like this with torchlight. It looked
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   like a National Geographic photograph. And so we had this translator that would yell out different
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.880]   parts of the play to them. That was about a three-and-a-half-hour play. And we started out.
[00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:31.200]   And as soon as the play began, Joan McIntosh, who was playing Mother Courage, and Jim Griffiths,
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:36.640]   who was playing the cook, burst into hysterical laughter. They started to cry and shake all over.
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:44.560]   And I just looked at them, and I wanted to be there. And I couldn't get in. And it was hell,
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:47.600]   because I knew what they were laughing at. And Richard Schechner was running up and down the
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:52.640]   sidelines saying, "What are they laughing at? What are they laughing about?" And so we started
[00:58:52.640 --> 00:58:57.680]   out the play, and we went through some of the actions. Now, I get hung up as Swiss cheese in a
[00:58:57.680 --> 00:59:01.840]   harness, kind of like a parachute harness. You know, I get hung, and that's how I'm executed.
[00:59:01.840 --> 00:59:08.320]   So they pull me up somewhere halfway into the play on this tree, on this banyan tree. And I'm
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:12.480]   up there under a full moon. Mariam Chani is playing the music from Brecht's Mother Courage
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:18.240]   on a harmonium out of tune underneath. And I think all I can think at this point is full moon,
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:26.160]   banyan tree, harmonium out of tune, Mariam, me, India. No past, no future. You know,
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:41.680]   I couldn't make sense out of it at all. Turn down, slang. To refuse the request, offer,
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:58.400]   et cetera, of a person, et cetera. One.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:22.400]   [ Pause ]
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:53.760]   [ Pause ]
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:01:00.640]   Punctuation. The practice, art, or system of inserting marks or points in writing or printing
[01:01:00.640 --> 01:01:05.760]   in order to make the meaning clear. The punctuating of written or printed matter with commas,
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:10.080]   semicolons, colons, periods, et cetera. Punctuation marks.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:13.680]   Two.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:36.640]   [ Pause ]
[01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:41.120]   So Richard Scheckner was running up and down, up and down, up and down, up and down the
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:45.760]   performance and finally he saw the natives were getting restless and he yelled, "Skip to the good
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:52.000]   parts. Skip to the good parts." And so we didn't know what the good parts were and they all started
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.280]   happening simultaneously. They were all the sensational parts. I.S. Swiss Cheese was running
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.560]   around with the cash box and he said, "Turn into a dance. Turn into a dance. Then shoot Katrine."
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:06.640]   That was one of the good parts. Lenny Sack was hanging up on a roof as Katrine, she was on a
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.760]   harness, very sensational. We took a big shotgun and blasted her, you know, and she fell. So boom,
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:16.400]   the shotgun goes off and I'm running around and she falls and it's a real condensed version of
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:21.440]   Mother Courage. And the shotgun set the natives off and they came charging across like a
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:26.160]   battlefield and we were all down in the pit by then singing the last song and I can remember just
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.880]   concentrating on this little toad that was hopping across the edge of this six-foot deep grave that
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:35.200]   we were all standing in. And we all had our rice and went to bed. That's the only thing we were
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.560]   eating there. Big mounds of very delicious white rice on a big green palm leaf. And then we went,
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:45.840]   got climbed under our mosquito netting and went to bed. Now it was there in that mud village that I
[01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:50.800]   met this wonderful school teacher. He was smiling. I don't know what he was smiling about. This was
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:55.840]   truly a happy man. He befriended me. His only possession was a paper-made pen and he wanted
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:03:00.720]   another one. And he would give, I'd just send him that or a refill. If I could send him two refills,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:07.200]   I would make his life. He was the local school teacher and he took me over and introduced me
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.240]   to his wife and family. This guy was, he was untouched by trouble and they just lived in mud.
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:14.880]   Swept, well-swept, very clean.
[01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:28.880]   Ogre. A monster, commonly represented as a hideous giant of fairy tales and popular legends,
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:36.640]   supposed to live on human flesh. Four. So I wanted to get out of there and I thought if we took,
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.520]   if we got, you see, if we got a big head start on that bus at the top of the Himalayas up here
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:45.680]   with enough momentum we could get back to New York City without have to making any decisions
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:49.520]   because I had lost my will and I was really afraid I wasn't going to make it back, that I would just
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:54.720]   end up in Ladakh. So we hitched up, we signed up for the bus and I thought now the one thing I'm
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.880]   going to do is sit very close to the emergency door because in India I never trusted any of the
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:04.000]   bus drivers or plane drivers or anything mainly because of reincarnation. You know, they all,
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.280]   they were all just new. They were coming back around again and there was no hurry and they
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:12.080]   were laughing all the time about it. And so there were Ladakhans on the bus and they were smiling
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.240]   and laughing, no fear of death. I knew those buses went over the edge all the time. No one ever
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:20.720]   talked about it. Why would they? And so I sat right next to the, I sat right next to the emergency
[01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:24.560]   door with my hand right on the handle. You know, the only problem was that the door opened directly
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:28.720]   over the precipice. So I thought, well, you know, at least we'll be able to have a freefall. The bus
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:33.440]   and I will be going separate. So we started down through all the seasons and it was winter and the
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:37.520]   glaciers. It was like winter. It was still the glaciers. It was early spring and they'd reach
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.440]   out and they'd make these snowballs and throw them around the bus laughing all the time. And then we
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:45.200]   were coming through spring as we got further down. They were picking flowers and passing them down.
[01:04:45.200 --> 01:04:51.040]   And then we were down into Srinagar. It was summer and we got on a plane and flew directly to,
[01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:56.080]   directly to New Delhi. And at New Delhi they told me that I had to declare how much money I'd made
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:59.760]   before I could leave the country. Now Indian bureaucracy is impossible because different
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:03.760]   places are closed according to different holidays. And I said, fuck it. I'm just getting on the plane.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.320]   I'm losing my momentum. I'm losing my will. So at the airport, they stopped me and they said,
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:12.960]   Mr. Gray, over here, have you got your papers? And I said, no. And they said, you may pass.
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:20.080]   So when that happened, I thought maybe I don't want to go. You know,
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:26.160]   they're trying to get rid of me. So I got conflicted, but I was too relaxed to make
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:30.640]   a decision because I had taken all these valuums. You see, you can buy valuums in any Indian drug
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:34.800]   store without a prescription. I was real nervous about flying 16 hours. And I got on the plane. I
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:39.360]   was totally hypnotized. I was looking out flying over the earth, you know, for 16 hours over giant
[01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:45.200]   Saudi Arabia, over giant Saudi Arabia, over giant Saudi Arabia, over giant Saudi Arabia, over the
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:48.960]   pyramids, over the pyramids, over Greece, which looked like the moon because there was no vegetation.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.520]   It wasn't even white, just like moonscape. And then at last the green, which I'd missed so much
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:57.600]   and not realized that the lush in Flanders, over Flanders, over Brussels, over Holland,
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:02.320]   and landing in Holland, it lasts. And I thought, don't go in. You had an open ticket. Don't.
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:07.040]   You don't have your will. Don't go into Amsterdam. Just take a little room here, right, for $15 at
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:11.040]   the Schiphol Airport. So I walked right in past the authorities, the long Dutch hairs. They don't
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.440]   stop you at all. They don't even want to see a passport. You could carry every kind of diamonds,
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:20.080]   hashish, heroin, whatever. And I came in a little voice said, hey, why don't you just go in for one
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:24.480]   night, you know? What the hell? You only live once. Go into Amsterdam for one night, you know?
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.480]   And then come back out. Stay with Jules and Mary. We got an open ticket. Be careful. So I got in,
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:32.640]   and I had complete reverse culture shock. As soon as I got off, I couldn't believe it.
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:38.160]   The vegetables looked like they'd been blown up with bicycle pumps. The cauliflowers were -- the
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:44.880]   artichokes were breathing sex giants. The Dutch looked like overgrown sex giants. And I told a
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:49.200]   taxi cab driver, you know, I got in the taxi cab, and all I heard was that little computerized
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:52.640]   register going biddly, biddly, biddly, biddly, biddly, biddly, biddly, biddly. And I said,
[01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:56.400]   you know, take -- everything looks so wealthy and padded. I said, take me to the lights of
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:07:00.640]   plane. Let me off. Now, I got off at the lights of plane, and I had this terrific chill, you know,
[01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:05.280]   just zzz, zzz, zzz, zzz. And I caught it. Ooh, I caught it. I thought I'd gotten it. You know,
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:09.520]   the last hour is in India. The last hour there, I got whatever it was, the bug, you know. And I,
[01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:14.800]   I, you know, I had gotten my gamma globulin shots, you see. Now, but the next morning,
[01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:19.200]   I woke up, and I was completely paralyzed, my neck. And I thought I'd got polio because I hadn't
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.880]   gotten my polio shots because I grew up as a Christian scientist, you see. So I probably
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:31.600]   thought I got it in India. Hallucination.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:41.120]   An apparent perception, as by cider hearing, to which there is no real external cause.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:58.720]   Seven. So, Jules and Miriam saw what condition I was in, and they said, you should go to my doctor,
[01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:02.720]   it's the woman doctor. And I, I went to the doctor, and she said, oh, you don't have
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:07.680]   poliomas de gray. I can tell you that. But what have you been doing? I said, well, I was staring
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:11.920]   out the window, you know, for 16 hours at giant Saudi Arabia, giant Saudi Arabia, giant Saudi
[01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:16.240]   Arabia on valuums. And she said, well, that would do it, you know. So what you have to do is you
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:20.400]   have to take these muscle relaxes and go right to bed, you know. You have some sort of fever,
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:23.920]   and your muscles are bound up, so at last I had something to do. You know, I was sick. It was
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:31.200]   wonderful. And I, I could go to bed, and I could feel, oh, just so bad, you know, up in Jules and
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.920]   Miriam's attic, and it was raining out, and it was June. It was that good old time bad feeling of
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.560]   being back in the West, and it was wonderful. And I was, the one thing I did was a mistake was I got
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.240]   a hold of a book there that I was kind of impressionable at the time because I was vulnerable
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:49.600]   and sick. It was David Cooper's The Grandma of Living, a protege of R.D. Lang's, and he had all
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.560]   of this ripe stuff about living in the 60s communes, about when he was tripping on acid, there'd be a
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:59.520]   little knock at the door, and there would be this woman, this beautiful woman in the commune, and
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.760]   next thing he knew, he was in a tantric position with her without speaking. They were just in these
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:09.280]   incredible tantric positions. What a time. And I was reading that book, and I thought, you know,
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:15.760]   if I, when I get better, I'm going to do this. By God, damn it all, I had, I was going to down to
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:19.760]   the Dom Square, and I was going to find preferably an Italian hippie because usually the Italians
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:23.440]   don't speak any English, and we would go back to Jules and Miriam's apartment because Jules and
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:27.760]   Miriam were going away, and I could get back there, and I would just, we'd fuck, and fuck,
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:33.040]   and fuck, you know, in every position on Jules and Miriam's dining room table, against the wall,
[01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:37.200]   without speaking, you know. So when I got better, I didn't even make it to the Dom Square because
[01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:41.040]   when I walked out, I thought, wait a minute, I'm supposed to be back in India. I left too early.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:45.120]   Maybe I should go back to India. No, wait a minute, Bali. I had planned to go to Bali, and I had some
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.280]   leftover traveler's check, but why not Greece? You know, so I'd have a few beers, and I'd go to the
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:54.400]   different travel agencies, so I would go into the Balinese one hoping that they would say, oh, no,
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.680]   Mr. Gray, you know, it's too hot there, it's summertime, but I'd get there, and they'd go,
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:02.880]   oh, Bali's fine any time of year, you know, prevailing winds, and you must go. So I would
[01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:08.640]   say, well, I will. All right, I'll go. You've got a cheap flight, but you have to get your visa,
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:12.640]   you know. Where do I get that? Up at The Hague. Oh, I was too fast, 45 minutes away, they said,
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:16.080]   so I couldn't even go up to get the visa. I'd have a couple more beers, and I'd talk about
[01:10:16.080 --> 01:10:20.240]   going to Greece. Then I began looking for signs, you know. I'd seen Indonesian men on the street.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:24.320]   There are lots of Indonesian men on the street in Amsterdam, but I'd ask this one man, where are you
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:29.120]   from? He said, Jakarta. And I said, when did you come here? 1941. All right, 1941. I was born in
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:34.080]   1941. That means if I go to Bali, I will die, you know, if I go to Bali, I will be reborn. No,
[01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:37.440]   wait a minute, wait a minute, I'd have a couple more beers, you see. And about this time Liz
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:40.480]   arrived, she didn't know I was still there, she arrived from Amsterdam, she'd stayed a week behind
[01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:44.960]   to study yoga, and all she'd learned was how to force vomit. She'd drink eight quarts of water and
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.880]   throw it up. And she was real positive, she was happy for that, because she'd always been afraid
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.560]   to throw up, so at least she'd learned how to do that. But she'd had enough, and she'd come,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.840]   and she had come to Jules and Marion's, because that was the only place to stay that we could
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:00.880]   afford. And we met up, and she said, look, you look in bad shape, I think you better go back.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.800]   You see, every morning I was calling up and saying, to the airplane, I was saying, this is Mr. Gray,
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:08.320]   I have an open ticket, I'd like to fly at six o'clock, you know, tonight. And they said,
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:11.120]   anything you say, Mr. Gray, you have an open ticket. And I'd go out and I'd have a couple of
[01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:14.480]   beers, and I'd think about Greece, and I'd come back and call them and say, no, no, cancel it,
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.160]   cancel it, I'm going to fly another time. Anything you say, Mr. Gray, you have an open ticket. And I
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:23.520]   was beginning to like this, you know. It was, no, it was more power than I'd had in all my life,
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:29.520]   you know. Big Royal Dutch 747, and so Liz, I said, you better go back with me. I said, sure,
[01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:33.200]   you make the reservation, you know, you do it, you call them, tell them we'll show up. We showed up
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:36.640]   at the airport, right, we got to the airport, and I started pacing around. She said, what's wrong?
[01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:41.760]   I said, I can't, I can't go, I have to go to Greece. And she said, wait a minute, all right,
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:45.920]   you better get your bags off the plane. So I went over to the woman, and I said, can you,
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:51.040]   no, skip it, just leave my bags on, I'm not going. She said, I'm sorry, Mr. Gray, you have to
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:54.480]   accompany your bags back to New York City, you know, they can't go without you. So I said, can
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:57.200]   you take them off? She said, I think we can, she got to walk and talk, yeah. I was like, wait a
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:05.680]   minute, she said, do you want, I said, yes, no, yes, no. I started barking at her, it was
[01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:10.560]   unbelievable. And her eyes were rolling in her head, and Liz just walked on ahead, as though she
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:17.280]   didn't know me, you know. And they watched me real careful when I got on the plane. I ended up flying
[01:12:17.280 --> 01:12:21.920]   back to New York City to accompany my bags, you see. That was the reason, and I got back, it was
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.920]   a seven minute trip, I remember the tip of Greenland, and when I landed, Ron Vorder came to
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:29.600]   the airport to pick us up, and he said, hey, listen, I've got to show you something, King Kong
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.360]   is at the bottom of the World Trade Towers, they're making a movie there, this big ape is lying there,
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:37.920]   you got to see it. I said, no, no, skip it, all right, get me home. He said, what do you mean home,
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:42.000]   your loft is sublet? And I realized the loft was sublet, and I couldn't believe it, and I had to go
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.920]   stay with friends. Now, they were trying to make a film, and they needed absolute silence, you know,
[01:12:45.920 --> 01:12:50.480]   they were really trying to concentrate, and it was summertime, and I started having this stuff come
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.880]   up in the base of my spine, I couldn't believe it. This unbelievable energy, you know, I'd wake up at
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:58.720]   six in the morning, and I'd be, oh, oh, groaning and rolling on the floor, and I was, oh, all the
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.120]   time you've seen people like this in the streets, I see them every day. I know, and I know what's
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:07.120]   going on now when I see them, they're brothers, I stay clear of them, but I know, oh, oh, I was like
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.680]   this, you know, terrific, like sparks of energy happening, you know. I didn't know what was going
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:14.720]   on at all, you know, people would say to me, you know, they'd have different ways of approaching
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:18.880]   it, some of my friends would say, you know, you're groaning a lot lately, you know, or someone else
[01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:23.200]   would say, you know, you know, why are you groaning, or there was this one Indian guy that was staying
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:27.120]   in the loft solely who would match me groan for groan every morning, I'd get up and go, oh, and
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:33.200]   he'd go, oh, oh, like this, so he was kind of taking a curative effect on me slowly. Now, people told
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:38.000]   me, this one psychiatrist friend of mine told me that I was now going through a severe nervous
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:41.680]   breakdown in which I was in the manic phase, which was kind of fun because I was getting a lot of
[01:13:41.680 --> 01:14:03.360]   attention, or a deal, any severe test or trial, a trying experience, three, but he said, soon you
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:10.960]   will hit the depression, and that won't be fun, and I don't know how it's going to manifest itself,
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:16.320]   and it came, and the way it manifests itself was I couldn't stay awake, I would just, anywhere,
[01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:22.400]   19 hours a day, I try to go buy food in the supermarket, I fall asleep in the Grand Union
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:27.600]   aisle, you know, I say, I'm just going to get up and have a little breakfast, lie on the couch
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:33.920]   here after breakfast, and it would be night, you know, now I was really afraid because I thought,
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:37.680]   you know, if I can't, if I'm going to have to kill myself, it's the first time I thought of suicide,
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:40.960]   because who's going to take care of me if I'm sleeping all the time, I can't make any money,
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:47.680]   and so what it was was I had to teach at NYU the experimental drama wing, you see, and that's how
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:51.760]   I was going to make my money to cure myself from this sleeping sickness, but I couldn't stay awake
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.680]   to teach the class, so we worked it out that the students would come down here to the garage
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:15:00.720]   upstairs, because I would fall asleep walking up to NYU, and Liz was going to be my assistant, so
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:04.960]   they propped me like a dummy in a straight back chair, and I was like this, you know,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.760]   for seven weeks I sat in that chair and said nothing, she ran the whole class,
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:14.960]   she ran the whole class, and at the end of seven weeks the students have a party,
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:21.280]   and they said we've never had a teacher like you, this silent method is fantastic, you know,
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.600]   the way we were thrown back on ourselves, the way we were aware of our projections,
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:33.760]   you know, not a word about Liz who happened to be a woman, and so they were saying that I should
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:42.320]   write a book. Now, long about this time I ran into Theodora Skipiterris on the street and she said,
[01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:46.080]   how are you, and I said I'm crazy, and she called Elaine Summers and told her this, and Elaine
[01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:52.560]   called me and said it's hypoglycemia, and you, you know, so she said you must go get checked,
[01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.840]   so I went up to the Friar Research and they gave me this test, all right, and they said you've got
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:02.080]   to stream hypoglycemia, you've got to give up tobacco, any alcohol, any marijuana, any kind of
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:07.360]   drugs, any kind of milk, dairy products, any kind of fruit or fructose, any kind of, and I said what
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.360]   am I going to eat, they said animal collagen made from intestines of animals that comes in three
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:19.520]   flavors, cherry, grapefruit, and orange, and it's flavored with saccharin, you know, so this is what
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:33.840]   I was living on. Anytime I get nervous I take a big... Thisby, classical legend, a maiden of Babylon
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.960]   loved by Pyramus. Pyramus killed himself when he saw blood which he mistakenly believed to be
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:46.880]   Thisby's and she killed herself. Two. I had never been to a funeral before I went to India. I was
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:51.200]   sure I was going to die in India. I got my gamma globulin shots here when I was over there. I went
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.880]   to get some more. I mean I felt I could have got one a week, but I, you know, I waited and I went
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:58.880]   into the, and the doctor said he got out a huge syringe like this. I said you're not going to use
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:03.760]   that, haven't you got to throw away, and he said did you bring your own? He was very insulted, so I
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:08.480]   finally got the courage up to go to Benares, you know, and now in Benares this is where they, if
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.720]   you're lucky, if you're wealthy and you have a house there, you can die there and they will put
[01:17:12.720 --> 01:17:16.960]   you on, they'll burn you right there on the Ganges and put your ashes in there and your firstborn
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:21.440]   son can bop your skull while you're burning and let out your spirit and you won't be reincarnated.
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:25.840]   So anyone with any money is there. Now I'm walking along. I never took my shoes off in India once.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:28.960]   There are two burning ghats and it didn't smell bad, you know. I was surprised. Those burning
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:34.240]   bodies smell like a barbecue and in the hot sun they're turning the bodies with a big prod. They
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:40.320]   look like a big big horse, a big roast, you know, big roast cows being barbecued and the dogs would
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:45.120]   be tearing at the pieces, you know, and I was walking down the beach, the sand between the
[01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:50.160]   burning ghats, where the bathing ghats are, and I came upon this guy lying in the sand. I looked
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:54.960]   down, his face is completely exposed. He had coins all over his robes and I realized the color of his
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:18:00.000]   face, he was so gray that he was dead in this hot sun and these coins they put on him, I asked about
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:06.080]   the coins, were because he was poor and no one could afford to buy the wood to burn him. So when
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.920]   people threw enough coins on him they would take the coins and they'd buy the wood and he'd have a
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:14.560]   proper burning. Now they didn't burn the holy men and they didn't burn people that died from cholera.
[01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:18.000]   They threw them in the Ganges and weighted them down and hoped they'd go to the bottom
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.760]   and rot and be eaten by alligators. Now, so I was out with these...
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:48.800]   Déclasse. Fallen or lowered in social rank, class, etc. One.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:52.640]   I was out with Jim Griffiths in a tour boat just as the sun was coming out. There was another tour
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:58.880]   boat behind us filled with Japanese photographers, Japanese tourists with cameras, and
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:03.280]   this arm was coming out of the water like this, you know, one of the bodies that they'd weighted
[01:19:03.280 --> 01:19:07.360]   down that didn't go down, you know, and it was like this and all the tourists, some of them were
[01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:11.200]   taking pictures and Jim and I were staring at it and the Indian authorities that were trying to
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:16.240]   keep the Ganges clean went out and were lassoing the arm, you see, to try to drag the body further
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:20.800]   out to sink it. We got back to shore and this, oh, upper middle class Indian could be a dentist. I
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:25.920]   think he was a dentist, you know, and he had a glass of this holy water, you know, of this water
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:29.440]   from the Ganges. It looks something like the East River, only more organic, and he was saying,
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:34.560]   "Have a drink." Perfectly sane man, you know, businessman.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.240]   Three more.
[01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:57.280]   On. Immediate proximity, i.e. to border on, absurdity.
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:20:01.280]   Two.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:13.920]   So I was rolling around, I was bouncing off the walls, and I finally said, "Please, please, look,
[01:20:13.920 --> 01:20:18.560]   look, just, just commit me. Take me to a room, a white room. I need my own room where I can bounce
[01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:23.120]   off the walls and not disturb anyone because I can't afford a hotel and there's no way, no one's
[01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:26.640]   going to take me in. I'm just bothering everyone." So they took me over to Beth Israel. Now, on the
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:31.440]   way to Beth Israel, I made a mistake. I smoked half a joint and this really, oh, oh, this really
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:36.640]   upped it. So the energy was just flying up out of my spine and I got into the Beth Israel and I was
[01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:40.800]   walking back and forth, you know, pacing, and they said, "Over here, Mr. Gray," the admitting
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:45.040]   psychiatrist said, "All you have to do is sign this paper here and you will have a white room,
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:50.080]   free of charge, you know. Come over here. Now, sit down. Can you please sit down? Just try to
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:55.360]   sit still for a moment." And I sat down. He said, "Now, what is it that you, what is your occupation?"
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:21:03.360]   I said, "I'm an actor. I mean, I'm an artist. I'm an artist. I'm an artist." And he said,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:07.280]   "Well, we understand you, sensitive artists. I play the clarinet myself."
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:14.720]   And so I didn't sign the paper. I didn't sign it. And I went back and I started rolling around
[01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:23.280]   some more and people were trying to tell me to call a psychiatrist. So at last, I called us.
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:34.800]   Triangulate. To divide into triangles.
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:40.160]   Three.
[01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:59.440]   When I wasn't walking, I went up in the hills and there were these shepherds
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:06.720]   that spoke English. They belonged to a shepherd commune in Kashmir, but they claimed they had
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:13.760]   never heard of Bombay, New Delhi, or New York City. And I think they were putting me on. They
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:18.480]   wore my sunglasses and they asked me to smoke some tobacco with them out of their earth pipe.
[01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:25.440]   And I said, "What earth pipe?" And they dug this hole in the ground and they put some sticks in
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.280]   and they put the tobacco on top of the sticks and they lit this little fire. And then they took this
[01:22:29.280 --> 01:22:33.760]   reed, this hollow reed, and stuck it down through the earth. So we were smoking out of the whole
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:40.480]   earth was our pipe. When I...
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:49.520]   They took the handcuffs off. They asked me to put all my money on the counter, take off my clothes,
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:56.080]   stand naked in a room, cover my eyes, shut my mouth. They sprayed me with a big gun of DDT
[01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:03.040]   powder. Poof! So what was that for? They said, "For the bugs." They took me into the holding
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:06.880]   cell. They said, "You have a chance to make one phone call." I said, "Who do I know in Las Vegas?"
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:11.120]   Besides, everyone in that holding cell was so interesting, I was fascinated. I figured they'd
[01:23:11.120 --> 01:23:17.280]   let me out by morning. In the morning came, they took me down and fingerprinted me and then put me
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:21.120]   in with 30 men. When I heard the door close, I thought I was going to go crazy. And I looked
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.360]   across to the next cell and he was a guy that looked very much like me with a beard, going
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:31.120]   crazy. And he was going, "My heart is going to pop. My heart is going to pop. My heart, my heart."
[01:23:31.120 --> 01:23:36.880]   And the prisoners were saying, "Get him out of here. Get him out." And they took him away to
[01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:43.120]   a padded cell. And I thought, you know, that could be me and I'm not going to do it. You know,
[01:23:43.120 --> 01:23:47.760]   I always thought I wanted to be in a padded cell, but now I know I'm going to have my own key if
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:53.120]   there is one, you know. And so I thought the best way to cope with it was to feel sorry for myself
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:58.000]   for how long that took. So I put a blanket over my head and cried for about 20 minutes. And then
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:02.320]   I thought the way I'll deal with it is to get to know the different prisoners and put them in
[01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:12.320]   categories. So I decided to indulge Peace. I lifted him up and dropped him, lifted him up and dropped
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:17.200]   him. He said, "Do it again." I lifted him up, dropped him. "Do it again." Finally, far into the
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:21.840]   afternoon with his mother, Caldonia, standing on the door saying, "I wonder what sign this guy is."
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:27.600]   I decided to go to the store. Peace said, "Can I come?" "Sure." I was driving then a pink and
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.560]   white polka dot Chevrolet, driving about 15 miles an hour because I had nowhere to go.
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:34.240]   I didn't think I'd ever go anywhere again.
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:49.360]   De crescendo. Gradually reducing force of loudness as opposed to crescendo.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:25:00.080]   One. And I got in the pink and white polka dot car and Peace got in. We drove down the
[01:25:00.080 --> 01:25:05.280]   market and I thought I'd indulge him, give him anything he wants. So he got his beef jerky and
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:09.440]   he got his Popsicle and he got his Tootsie Pop and he got all sorts of sweet things and he was eating
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:16.000]   them all simultaneously. And I was just about his age and I was riding back driving 15 miles an hour
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.400]   and we got to the house where the biker women were staying and I suddenly had this incredible
[01:25:20.400 --> 01:25:25.520]   adult voice come out of me. I don't know from where. I turned to him and said, "Aren't you
[01:25:25.520 --> 01:25:32.480]   going to thank me, Peace?" And he turned to me and he held up each half-eaten item and he went,
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:42.240]   "Thank you for this. Thank you for this. Thank you for this. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you."
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:46.320]   And then he got out of the car and slammed the door.
