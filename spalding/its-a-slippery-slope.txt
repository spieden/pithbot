[00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   The first mountain, the first mountain that I ever remember seeing, I saw framed in the pane of my window in geometry class, Freiburg Academy, Freiburg, Maine, 1956.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And I couldn't stop staring out the window at this, I mean, I'd hardly call it a mountain today, maybe 1,500 feet high, but it was the first relief I'd experienced in my life, and let me tell you, I was in need of relief.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Because I'd come up from Rhode Island in the flatlands, where I was failing everything in Barrington High School, and my father said, "Either you go away to Freiburg Academy, or you'll end up in the Navy."
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   So off I went to the gulag, and I was taking all the college preparatory classes, including geometry, but I was failing geometry, because I felt this pull, and my God, I couldn't stop staring out the window at this, it looked like an exotic dessert.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   It looked like marshmallow sauce melting over coffee or chocolate ice cream. What were these white fingers at the top of this mountain, I wondered? Turned out they were ski trails cut by the Freiburg ski team, and if you went to Freiburg Academy, I found out, you could take free ski lessons, and I wanted to take free ski lessons, but I was failing geometry, and I thought if I failed geometry, I won't be able to go to college, and you've got to go to college if you want to afford to ski.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   So instead I went back to my dormitory room, you know, it was so much warmer, you know, because then in 1956, we had real winters, 30 degrees below zero, not wind chill, 30 degrees below, 15 foot high snow banks, I could hear the elm trees snap for like a rifle shot outside my window from the cold.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And I would go back and fantasize about skiing and listen to Beethoven, actually, I had online symphonies, one a day and three on Sundays.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And I was failing geometry, and I failed.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And somehow, I don't know how or why, Boston University, maybe they didn't notice I failed, maybe they needed more students that year, they accepted me.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   And off I went to the big city, forgetting all about the gulag and the mountains and skiing, and was put in Miles Standish Hall, the dormitory there in Kenmore Square, the BU dorm on the top floor, actually the highest I'd ever been in my life on the seventh floor.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   And I was in a bit of a panic because my bed was right by the window, and I kept rearranging the bed, but basically the room was so small it pretty much ended up by the window.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Now why was I upset? I was upset about this bed being by the window because I was reading Freud for the first time.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   In Psychology 101 I was reading Freud, and I read that Freud had discovered the unconscious. I don't remember how, but he had.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Now this was a shock for me, because up until then I had thought I was here.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I didn't know there was a whole part of me missing, an "un" that if you can't see it could go on forever.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And I began to suspect that this "un" housed all the self-destructive shadow aspects of myself, and that if I was to relax and go to sleep in the bed, the "un" would wake up, take over my body in the night, and jump out the window with it, you see?
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And halfway down my conscious self would be grasping at the bricks trying to save myself.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Now this was so upsetting to me that I transferred to Emerson College down the road.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Because they had two-story dormitories, you see? Not unlike the house I grew up in in Barrington, so I felt safer.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Now this transfer to Emerson was very important, and I didn't know how important it was going to be, because there at Emerson I encountered my, and I didn't even know I was looking for it, my passion theater, most specifically acting.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I thought, that's it, that's what I want to be, an actor. To live a passionate life on stage without consequences.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   You never really have to make up your mind who or what you want to be. You could be a father, a lover, a killer, a cop.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   You could be a tortured Russian writer that shoots himself in the head one night, comes back the following night to shoot himself again, you see?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I wanted to be a not-be. Oh, the glorious imitation of life. To lead a passionate life on stage, to come home, have a couple of beers, veg out, go to sleep, boom, die.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Make it through without ever having had to live. That was my ambition.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Now it began to wear thin after college, and what happened was that the writer's voice began to push the actor out.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Now, what do I mean by writer? I was dyslexic. I couldn't spell, I could barely write, I could hardly read. I didn't know that had nothing to do with writing.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   The self-reflective writer's voice began to push the actor out. How? I couldn't really memorize my lines properly. Never could get them right would paraphrase.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So one day it occurred to me, the little voice whispered, "What if indeed you were speaking your own lines? What would they be?"
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And I gave in to the temptation in 1979 in the performing garage in downtown Manhattan at a table not too much unlike this, maybe a little smaller.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I performed my first monologue and called it "Sex and Death to the Age 14."
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Nothing too dramatic really, basically masturbation and the death of goldfish.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   But this began to unlock memories, and a whole little cottage industry grew of monologues, of autobiographic monologues.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And I began taking them out on the road wherever people would ask me to go. I became like an inverted method actor, really.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   I was using myself to play myself. I was playing with myself.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   And out I would go, I didn't care, but whoever asked me I would go, I'd find out about the place when I got there, you know, Austin, Aspen, whatever.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And often I would go off with my girlfriend Renee who would travel with me. When Renee was with me everything would always go smoothly.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   I would never get in trouble, never get lost. But other times I'd like to get in trouble, get lost, have that, you know, synchronistic serendipity soup.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   You know, and get involved in other people's dramas and get them involved in my dramas and have wild affairs with strange women and strange affairs with wild women.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So off I went to take my monologue, Monster in a Box, I was invited to go to Aspen with it, Aspen, Colorado. I didn't know anything about Aspen. I said yes.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I mean if I had an image of Aspen back then I suppose it might have been cocaine.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   That's no. Those lines.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   But I, we were taking out of Denver and I was in one of those little, Renee and I were together in a 19-seater little beach craft and I was right by the window.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   And as we took off it was just sunset and we're taking out of Denver and all of a sudden I'm looking out the window and go, oh my God, look at the size of those white beauties down there.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Are we in America, Renee? Oh, a pool, I can feel now that gut-wrenching pool is so much larger than geometry class.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Oh sure, I'd seen the Rocky Mountains before, flying to California 35,000 feet up, but never had I been so close that I could feel that gut-wrenching pool.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   When I got in Aspen I was pacing in the Jerome Hotel like a moonstruck lad, could not sleep, staring out the window at the morning at Ajax Mountain towering like a giant high, 11,000 foot high frozen tsunami about to crash down on the town of Aspen.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And down into coming these gods and goddesses with rooster tails of white shooting up out of their skis and I say, Renee, we must go up on this mountain, we must go up and see the gods and goddesses come to hell.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Let's get closer to this thing. So up we go in the Silver Queen gondola, we're the only ones without skis or ski outfits.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   We're rocking in the wind, I get out, I'm breaking through the snow, crashing in my Soho great coat, I'm snow-blind, I got the collar turned up, a dock-worker sat down from Canal Street.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Renee is dressed in black with a Persian lamb black hat, she looks like she just came over the Berlin Wall.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   And I'm staggering around, all of a sudden I get my eyesight back and I see, whoa, I'm surrounded by my people, Chetty, Puffy, Babs, Sis, Jim, all my people.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Only they passed geometry, calculus, algebra, trigonometry and went to Harvard, Brown and Yale and now they're skiing. With three children they're skiing, you know, my people having fun in the day.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   They all have that inner cheerleader voice, someone told them to go for it and they went for it and they got it. They're all dressed like Easter eggs, very expensive Easter eggs.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And there is this white edge there at the mountain and I think it's the white edge of the world, the children are disappearing over it. I have no idea that they're traversing, I don't know what traversing is, I think the kids are going straight down the mountain.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And the view, oh my God, Renee, I've never seen so many theirs there. I could be there, I could be there, I could be there, I could be there.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Oh, the sudden partial gratification of omnipotent ubiquity. Wow!
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And I caught a fairy pad head cold.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   And downloaded on the silver queen thinking why would these gods and goddesses come to the Wheeler Opera House to hear me do a monologue, Monster in the Box, why would they come down to hear my ironic, hypochondriacal, non-athletic voice?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Perform a monologue about me, a man who can't write a book about a man who can't take a vacation.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   On we went, touring Monster across the United States, I tried to forget all about that white god Naveen, oh, put it out of my mind, pretend I never saw the top of that mountain. I opened Monster in the Box and Lincoln sent it to good reviews, then there was a good run there, and then the book, the movie, the video, the void.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   What next? Another monologue, what else? There's always a new impingency, a new crisis. I hoped I wasn't making them up, just the material.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   I was losing my sight in my left eye, I hoped I wasn't bringing that one on, and I did a monologue about it and called it Grey's Anatomy, and was developing it across the United States, once again with Renee at my side, helping to direct it, and we got as far as the Scottsdale Arts Center in Scottsdale, Arizona, and I began to bitch and moan about how I was tired of sitting at a table in a windowless art house recollecting.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   I was losing touch with my body, I had to get out and do something, so the plan was this, when we finished the run at Scottsdale, we would go up to Flagstaff, stay overnight with a friend of mine, and in the morning go over to the Grand Canyon, and I was going to climb down the Bright Angel Trail from the top to the bottom and back up in a day.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   That's how I was going to get in touch with my body.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   So up we went, we were staying with my friend David Chase, and in the morning I was in his kitchen and looking out the kitchen window, and BOW! Whoa! Those white fingers again! David, look, you live at the base of a ski slope, the San Francisco Mountains right outside his kitchen window.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   Whoa, let's go up, let's go up and check it out, let's go up and see the gods and goddesses come down before we go over to the Grand Canyon.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   So up we go, and Renee sees a sign for ski lessons, and I say, "Oh no, please, you've got to have a death wish to do that, and if you did it could be dangerous."
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   So off we go to the Grand Canyon, and as I start down into the Grand Canyon, I realized very quickly that, wait a minute, Renee's staying up at the top, I've got the crampons on, it's kind of icy and slushy, and I go, "Wait a minute, this Grand Canyon is basically an upside-down moat."
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It's an inverted moat. It's a depression. It's a very big depression. And the further I am going down into shadow and ice, the more depressed I feel myself becoming, until I cry out, "Light! Light, Renee! Give me light!"
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Let's take the lesson. So back we go for the ski lesson, and as I get closer to it, I realize it's not so much the skiing that I'm afraid of, it's the lesson.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   I have never learned anything in my life. I am still perpetually lost. I stop at service stations, you know, get directions. They want to draw me a map. I say, "Anything but a map, please, it's like a bad geometry class."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Isosceles, Sausalito, whatever. Just give me images. Left at McDonald's, straight at the live oak tree, right at the purple house. Please, not a map.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   I never have made anything from a recipe, I just toss it into a pot. When I was a kid, I was building a model airplane, it turned out to be a gluey ball with wings coming out of it.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And when I was 16, all my friends were rebuilding their engines. I didn't have an engine to rebuild, so I bought a .44 coupe, took the engine out, got it down in the basement, tore the entire engine apart.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   My father paid $35 to have the empty body of the car towed out of the yard. So we are standing there, waiting for our ski professor to come out, and out he comes.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   And says, "He's a retired heart surgeon," he says. And now he's doing what he's always wanted to do, ski instructing. And aren't we lucky to be there on a cloudless spring day, on 150 inches of packed powder looking out over the rim of the Grand Canyon. And so we were, and so we began.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And we started, it reminded me of the geometry class, actually, in an oscillating way, with that damn triangulation, the snowplow. And I'm doing the caveman crunch, but I'm doing it.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   And then we begin to turn in the traverses, and everyone is going left and right, including Rene. Everyone in the class except me, I'm the only one that can only go left.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   I can only traverse the slope left, right seems like an idea.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   But I'm loving the left traverse. I'm going across left and snowplowing down, rope toe up, left down, hi everyone, left, left.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   Soon the class is over, Rene has turned her equipment and is beckoning to me, we have to go to catch her airplane out of Phoenix Airport. And I say, "Rene, I can't go until I turn right."
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   She said, "There'll be another time." I said, "How do you know?"
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   In the car she was driving, you would not have wanted to have been there, I am moping, "Oh no, I'm never going to learn how to ride an element, this is my last chance, I've never learned anything before, I want to go back, I want to turn right on skis."
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   We get to the airport, and then checking my bags in, and all of a sudden as I put them on the scales, I become paralytic.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I'm just, I go, "Oh, come on, I'm not, I can't fly today, I have to go turn right on skis."
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   "What's wrong Mr. Grey?" "Do you know if there's a ski lodge up there, I didn't see a place to stay, if I was to go up there on my own, Mr. Grey, we're not travel agents here, are you flying with us to Newark or not?"
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   I say, "Why don't you just put my bags on, I'll stay." "You have to accompany your bags." "I can't, wait, have you ever heard the weather report, I can't, wait, wait, no, no, no, no, no, no, let me think, just a minute."
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   Meanwhile, she's going over to the head stewardess saying, "I think we have someone here that should not be on this flight tonight."
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Rene has got me over in the corner saying, "Spalt, what is wrong?" I say, "I tell you what's wrong, I'm tired of being a ficarion."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   "You know, I want to live a life, not tell one. I want to turn right on skis."
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   She said, "That's it, time for intervention, I'm calling your brother Rocky in St. Louis."
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Rene gets my older brother Rocky on the phone and says, "You've got to help me out, I'm here in the Phoenix airport with Spud, Spud won't get on the plane because he can't turn right on skis."
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   "Put him on." "Rock, aye, yeah, hm?" I love it, I love this skiing thing, and I wanted, I could go left and it's lots of fun, but I haven't turned right, I want to stay here until I turn right.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   "Well don't you have a rough life."
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   "Look," he says, "Why don't you fly back to New York with Rene, when you get there, go up to New England, call up to Vermont, go up there, learn to ski with your people."
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   "Didn't you know if you could learn to ski in New England you could ski anywhere?" I'd never heard that shingle before.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   But with that in mind, if you can learn to ski in New England and ski anywhere, back I went, got back to New York City, called up to Vermont, they had no snow.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Now they were supposed to have it, but they didn't have it, and I didn't understand at the time, at the time I thought it was global warming, after these past few years I'd say it's weather psychosis.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Nature's imitating us. It's fucked.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   Now I don't know about your TV weather people, but in New York City it goes like this, "Hi everyone, hey this is the fifth day of 70 degree temperatures in the middle of February, Los Angeles has nothing over us."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   No, it's as though this nuclear weather is something to be desired.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   But I'm back and I can't get out and I want to ski and that's all I can think of, I am so desperate to ski I'm going out and renting ski videos.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   Yes, what a bore. They're like porn films.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   Same exhibitionistic gymnastics, same music.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Same vicarious, lonely, oh god I wish I was in the center of all that feeling.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   My friends can see that I'm very upset, some are recommending classical psychoanalysis, saying you know sometimes a ski is not a ski.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Others are recommending Prozac, and the ones I'm listening to are saying, "Paul, you work very hard, perhaps too hard, you should owe it to yourself to take some of your savings, go learn to ski, if it takes six months a year just go concentrate on that, you know you really ought to, you only live once you know."
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Why do I keep forgetting that? But here's the situation, I'm back in New York City, that's why I didn't want to get on the plane, once I'm back in New York how do I get out?
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   It's a soul killing day long drive to the airport and then you have to fly once you get there.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   So you get into the inertia of the place and walk around thinking about what you'd be doing if you weren't there, that's what I did anyway.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   And I'm trying to think of an average day back then, well I'd wake up after seven hours sleep, I never sleep beyond seven hours so it's an organic wake up around seven thirty eight o'clock.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And I go in and take my first morning pee and immediately hear that little voice in my head say, "Remember, you're going to die."
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Imagine, I forgot that for seven hours. Now this thought would usually cause an erection.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And I would go in and have very anxious sex with Rene to work off my fear of death and then lying there in a heap of petite mort,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   I might get out the Mayo Family Clinic disease book to see if I had any symptoms that morning.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Overall there are two thousand seven hundred and forty diseases in that book, how could I not have one?
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And then do some yoga stretches and have breakfast coffee, write in my journal a little bit what I write, what would I write, or maybe something like what I'm telling you now.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   And then I'd go to the bookcase and get out a book for morning reading, maybe an old time favorite, Becker's Denial of Death.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   Underlined profusely in red, and read the following, "The irony of man's condition is that the deepest need is to be free of the anxiety of death and annihilation,
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   but it is life itself which awakens this anxiety and so we shrink from being fully alive."
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   And closing the book, I go out for a walk in New York City to try to be fully alive.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   Where do I go? I'm no longer a consumer and I'm tired of the architecture.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   So I'm searching for a park, you know, an open space, one that I can walk to preferably.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Washington Square Park happens to be the closest to me, basically a dysfunctional fountain with broken benches around it.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   So around and around that fountain I go, just walking in circles, peeling the onion in my mind.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Around and around I go, thinking about what? Thinking about where will I go to turn right on skis to learn how to do it?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Or thinking about Kathy, a woman I met on the road who moved to New York City and sent me a letter with her phone number.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Should I give her a bus, call her up, maybe drop in for some tea?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Or thinking about how I'm about to be 52 years old and my mom killed herself at 52.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And would I join her? Would I kill myself by accident or on purpose if I got closer to that age?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And around and around that fountain I go peeling the onion in my mind, running into the same Jamaican drug dealers trying to sell me the same drugs each time round,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   because they don't realize I'm the same person.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Each time round they're saying, "Hey man, what's happening?" And I say, "Good question. What is happening?"
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And then exhausted from walking around the fountain I go over finally to the PETA stuff up there on West Broadway
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   and have myself a whole week PETA stuff with, if it's a nice day, sit out on the deck there and just peel the onion in my mind a bit more.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Oh, I'm thinking about mom, thinking about Kathy, thinking about where would I go to turn right on skis.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   Oh my goodness, you are very fragmented today, aren't you?
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   And no, I think no I'm not. There's a whole part of me watching the fragmentations.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Then I try to see the whole part that's watching the fragmentations.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Then I try to catch the part that's watching the whole part that's watching the fragmentations.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Until a beautiful woman walks by and I'm present.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Then back to my loft I walk.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Oh, shadow time. My God, the sun is already going down behind the telephone building on Worcester Street.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Nap time. Put out my yoga mat, get out the little stereo Walkman that I'm going to listen to.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Lie down, put on my favorite spoken word afternoon tape to relax to.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   PETA coyote reading from Zen mind beginner's mind.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   The battery's running low.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   The basic teaching of Buddhism is transiency or change.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   That everything changes is the basic truth for each existence.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   The cause of all suffering is our non-acceptance of this truth.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Without accepting the fact that everything changes, we cannot find perfect composure.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And off to sleep I go, waking up to darkness, no slight depression, oh, cocktail hour, get it out.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   Get out the V8, Tabasco, Worcestershire, horseradish, lemon, celery, sky, vodka, mix, shake, pour it, kick back,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   turn on the news, all things considered, and wait for Renee to come back from her office
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   where she's been working on her ongoing film script.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   That was my day back then. Nothing too traumatic, really.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   That is, before the big change came.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Now what was the new crisis? What was the new impingency?
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Was I making it up or was it making me up?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   This business of turning 52 and how my mom killed herself at 52 and I really had never given it any thought
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   and then I got closer to it, I began to think a lot about how I might join her, how I might--
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I knew I wasn't my mother.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   At least that's what friends told me.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   But I think that I had really identified with her.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   I was the middle son. I was there for two extreme nervous breakdowns, one ending in her suicide.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   I got to observe her behavior and be very close to her.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And then I began to have--well, I don't think I was having them.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   It was though the suicide panties were having me, the fantasies would start like a film in my head
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and I would watch them. I would embrace them. I saw them as fantasies.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   I would watch them so we'd even talk about them. I remember the first.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   It was when I was traveling in Ireland with Renee and we went down to the Cliffs of Moors,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   which are those 400-foot high cliffs looking out over the Aran Islands
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   and we were there--most of the tourists were there because it was a cocktail.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   A sundown Irish sunset, really, a gray sky over a gray sea.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Gray observed by gray.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   And I'm standing there drinking a can of Guinness stout and looking out over the Aran Islands
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   and all of a sudden it just flashes on me that I want to commit what I could only call a roadrunner suicide.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   In which I got back in a cow pasture and ran by Renee full speed, beep, beep, and shot out over the cliff.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And just before I dropped down into my watery grave, I would turn and see the last expression on her face
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   and see that and take it in and know it and that would be the last mission that I would take.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I could not stop thinking about this and I couldn't stop crying every time I thought about it
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   and I couldn't stop telling Renee the fantasy over and over and over again.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   Now the next one that hit was when I was traveling alone in Taos, New Mexico.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   And now a hot tub--not a fantasy, a reality--there was a hot tub outdoors behind my hotel.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   And the fantasy was to go out there at night under a very moonless desert night,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   a starry night, and get in the hot tub and get ever so relaxed and then take a big handful of quaaludes
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   and get really relaxed and then draw a very sharp straight edge razor across my wrist.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   But I thought, where would I ever find quaaludes?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   And once I did, wouldn't they give me such a sense of well-being that I wouldn't want to do this?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Now, around the time that these silly fantasies were going on and occurring to me,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   a very powerful synchronicity happened.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   Steven Soderbergh, the film director of Sex, Lies, and Videotape and Kafka,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   approached me to be in his new film, King of the Hill.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And he said that he was approaching me and me only for the role of Mr. Mungo.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   He had no one else in mind because he'd read my book, Impossible Vacation,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   and was casting me through having read the book, which I thought was a very interesting and odd way
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   to cast someone, an actor in a film, through reading his book.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   But he claimed that the character in my book, Impossible Vacation,
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Bruce de Northup, character, was ruled by regret.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   And the character in his film, Mr. Mungo, that he wanted me to play,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   was ruled by regret to the extent that he kills himself.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I said, oh, really, Steven?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   How does he do it?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   And Steven says, well, right now I have him slitting his wrist.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   I'll do it.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   So I thought here was a very creative chance to work out all of these fantasies with a good director.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Now, if you haven't seen the film, and I do recommend it, it's on video,
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   it's about a boy, a 14-year-old boy surviving the Depression by befriending people in this hotel, Mungo being one.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   One day he sees blood coming out of under the door, opens it,
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   and there's Mr. Mungo with his head down on this thing, having slit his wrist.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   It was a very strong experience for me working on this film
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   because Steven, as a director, encouraged me to dip into what I could only call my well of sadness,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   which I have never done in a monologue or in a film before.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   And he was pushing me to do it, and I was doing it, and I was afraid of it, but it was feeling okay.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   But I tell you, what I wanted to do when I finished that film,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   being in that well of sadness, was to celebrate in a wholesome, up, positive, joyous way,
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   which I knew nothing about.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   I mean, my idea of celebrating it after a film had always been rather Dionysian,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   very self-indulgent, slightly self-destructive way.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   But I had an idea of how I was going to accomplish this up big way.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   I had befriended my stand-in in the film.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   Now, a stand-in is a thankless job.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I rarely talk to them. They're like non-beings.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   They are paid to sit or stand in for you while the scene is lit, and then they step out in your film.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   They never appear on film.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   My stand-in I befriended. His name was Barney.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   I befriended Barney because he was not an aspiring stand-in or actor.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   He was essentially a ski bum.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   That was his passion, and what he'd do was take his stand-in money
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   and get inexpensive flights and Reno air up to Reno,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   and he'd add a truck park there in one of the parking lots of the hotel with his skis
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   and drive up to Tau and ski all the time, in all seasons.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   He even skied in July, and as soon as we finished that film,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   I knew he was going to go up there and teach me how to turn right.
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   So I just wanted to kill myself and get out of there.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Now, it's going very smoothly.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   We were shooting a sequence, and the powerful moment, the suicide day comes.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Oh, it took at least two hours to make me up.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   They put gauges here that were raised so they looked like deep cuts.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   Dry blood running down my hand, ash and white face, 90/20/90 suit.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I looked like a dead man.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   After two hours of that, then they lead me down.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   There's another two hours arranging the mess, the suicide mess.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   The straight edge razor shears my face down the sink.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   The blood has to be choreographed over the edge of the sink with glycerin
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   and out under the door so the camera can pan over the blood.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   So not only do you get to meditate for two hours on your own suicide,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   you also get to meditate for another two hours on what a mess you leave for your loved ones.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   It should all go smoothly, and I expect we're going to get right out of there
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   because we're going to leave right from the set and go to the plane up to Reno.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And Stephen doesn't say it's a wrap.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   He says, "Set up for the next scene."
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   I say, "But what next scene, Stephen? I'm dead.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   I don't get resurrected. It's not in the script."
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   He said, "No, you get carried out on a stretcher under a sheet."
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   I said, "But Stephen, if I'm under a sheet, no one is going to see me.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   Why do I have to stay? Let my standing--"
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   "My standing is going with me. I can't-- Stephen, why don't you do it?"
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   He says, "Spalding? You don't want to be in my movie?"
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   I go, "I see what you're saying. If you put it that way, well, hey,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   it's going to take you an hour to light the scene easily, isn't it?
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Let me go back to the hotel, you know, dressed as I am,
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   and grab my bags, check out, and then I'll be here.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   We'll be closer to the airport. We'll make it to the plane."
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   He lets me go.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Looking like a dead man. I'm going in the back of the car.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   The team's just driving. I'm in the back like this, and he's--
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   You know, just don't lead on the car. It's Hollywood.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   I'm checking out at the hotel, and they have to check out the desk.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   The woman goes, "How's the film going, Mr. Gray?"
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   And I go--
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   She goes, "Oh, gross out.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Should we leave your incidentals on your Amex card?"
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   I said, "Am I not affecting anyone here? Is this not real?"
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And this 11-year-old diabolical Halloween energy comes over me,
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   and I think, "I am not going to leave this hotel till I genuinely affect someone."
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   And I go into the pharmacy there in the hotel,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   and there's a lone woman in there in the back filling prescriptions.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   And I was going to say she reminded me of my mother,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   but my mother was a Christian scientist. She'd never been filling prescriptions.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   Something was going on there, some association.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   And I walked up with my sleeves rolled up and went,
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   "Do you have anything for my wounds?"
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   And she went, "Ahh!
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   We have mercurochrome, mercurochrome."
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   Oh, my God. I knew she was in shock.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000]   She didn't even look for bandages. She ran off looking for mercurochrome.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   It must have been the 1929 outfit.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And she said, "Whatever did you do?"
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I said, "I slit my wrist this morning."
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   And I didn't realize I was trying to kill her.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   You know, I was trying to reverse history.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   I was saying, "Hey, Mom, look what it looks like from over there."
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   And I just apologized and said, "I'm sorry, I'm in a movie," and I ran.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   I get back, I said, "Barney, let's get out of here.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Hollywood's making me cuckoo. Let's go turn right on skis."
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   So we finished it, and I thought I was going to get out of there,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   and the next thing happens. I always forget this new contingency.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   It happens often when I'm doing a film.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   You're so concentrated on your work, you don't see the people around you.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   It's like you have blinders on.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And when they say it's a wrap and you know you're never going to see these people again,
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   all of a sudden, oh, I see a woman and I fall into her eyes.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   It's a gaze.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   It's never an actress, production assistant, someone doing props.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   The woman's name was Donna Lane.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I will never forget those madras plaid Bermuda shorts
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   and white V-neck T-shirt and those eyes.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Oh, Donna, oh, I've come home. Oh, God, let me just speak to you.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   How could anything that feels so good be bad?
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   But I'm supposed to go skiing with a guy.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Why would I go skiing with a guy? What if there's no snow?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Did I be stuck in a condo with a strange guy?
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   I'd seen a ski condo once before. It's like an architectural bardo.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   When I could be in the desert tripping on mushrooms with Donna,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   I just got to get...
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   And then this paralytic thing happens where I'm doing neither
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   because I also have the bubble fantasy of Renee waiting for me back in New York above my head.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   So there's this triangle happening, and I'm not going skiing.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   I'm going to miss the plane. I can't speak to Donna.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   And, boom, what a shit event. I pull away.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   It was a big one, and I run off with Barney to go try to turn right,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   although I'm projecting Donna's eyes on his eyes all the way to the airport,
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   Donna's face on his face.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   We get up to Reno, and it's night by now, and I have to say I don't see any snow.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   And Barney says, "Snow at higher altitudes spalled."
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   Snow at higher altitudes.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   I want to believe him. I want to trust him.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000]   We're starting up out of Reno, up the back of Mount Rose, heading for Tahoe,
[00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   and by the time we get to the top of Mount Rose, it's snowing.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   He's right. It's a big Sierra dump. The four-wheel vehicle is weaving.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   I am so excited, have forgotten all about Donna Lane, and put...
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Hey, let's get this stuff out here. We'll put it out so we get up very early.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I put the echinacea over here, the orange over here, the sunblock chapstick, my goggles.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I'm going to put my stuff close to the heater. Isn't that what they do?
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   So it'll be warm in the morning. Put it over here.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   I can't sleep. I'm like a kid at Christmas. I never doubted my law before noon.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   I feel like a fireman, you know? I don't want to get up and get out and turn.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   I'm just tossing and turning, getting up and looking out the window. It's still snowing.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   I get back in bed. I sleep a little bit more. It's 6 o'clock, and I'm opening up.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Barney, it's still snowing. Barney, get your coffee going. I'm going to get dressed.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   We're going to get over there early, start out, put on my thermal socks and thermal bottles at the top,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   a little coffee, and put on my bibs, pull up the bibs, and put on my turtleneck sweater.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   No. Frisk goes on. Turtleneck sweater goes over there. A little more coffee, then put on my shell, a little more coffee,
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   and, oh, got to take a shit.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And we're off. And we are driving to Alpine Meadow, Barney's favorite PC slope.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   They're at Alpine Meadow, no snowboarders about it, he says.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   They have hot broccoli soup. You don't even have to microwave it.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   They have classical music, playing over metal speakers, no rock and roll.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And they have an adoptive handicapped school known as Adoptive Ski School there in California.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And we arrive, and it's too early. They haven't opened the lifts yet.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And all the locals are there. And they are just, oh, rock and roll, high five, man.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   Fat snow, fat snow, awesome, all right, fat snow.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It is fat. That damn mountain was skinny the day before. It has this great Santa Claus belly.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Dynamite is breaking up the avalanches, rumbling, I can feel it rumbling in my chest.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   Powderhounds on fat skis.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   And I'm going to turn right.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   They pull the Day-Blo tape and up we go, Barney and I on the lift, and we start down on a blue slope.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And I am going left, no matter what I'm doing, left, left, left, into the bushes and out the other side with branches in my mouth like a bottom chalet.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   I say, Barney, I'm embarrassed. I'm not going to hang you up anymore.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   I'm not going to force you to try to teach me. I've got to do this on my own.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   I'm going off on my own. And I go off to the bunny slope, to Meadow, to the green slope.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   And I find myself totally and utterly inspired because I am right in the middle.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And I didn't even know I'd end up there in the middle of the handicapped or adoptive ski school.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   And they are taking quadriplegias out of wheelchairs and putting them in gondolas with skis and these crutches with little skis on them.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And I think, oh my God, Spalding, if you don't turn right on this slope today, give it up.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   Let it go.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   And I begin, and damn it all, I crash, yacht sail, yacht sail, everything flies everywhere, yacht sail, and I'm up.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   But I tell you what keeps me going is the fact that I'm not breaking anything.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   I mean, I am so limber, I cannot believe that I recuperate from these yacht sail crashes.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And I'm up, I still, I can't get that damn right turn. And then all of a sudden, it happens, the ineffable.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   I have no words for it or I tell you.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   The last time I had something happen to me like this was 1946 on Thanksgiving Day when I first learned how to pump on a swing.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   There was a shift of weight.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   It happened.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Suddenly I was going right, left, right, left, right, boom.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   I was down and I was up, but I was skiing.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And I started to ski, if someone ski-banned me really fast though, I'd crash.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   If someone ski-banned me and fell, I crashed, I was in such empathy.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Or if I was skiing and I went, "Oh my God, Spalding, you're skiing!"
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   You know, it was like Zen, only not as subtle.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   And what I realized at that moment was all my life I had been committing a subtle form of suicide.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   I'd always been slightly upsetting myself from the place I was in, thinking I could be over there, I should be there, would that person be there, I could be there or there or there.
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   If I was doing that when I was skiing, boom, yeah, I was down and the mountain hit me heavy.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   The other thing that I liked, when I was up and centered, I was both in motion and still at the same time.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   Another thing that I liked was going down was an upper.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   Going up was a downer. I like that reversal.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   And I was so excited I went to meet Barney at lunch and told him all about it.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   And we went out after lunch to ski on a blue trail together and now it was a two-dye day.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   The storm had passed and that bright California spring sun was illuminating that white slope.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   And we were hopping through the furrows where the other skiers had gone.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   Skiing now on packed powder. Oh my God, nothing to do.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Oh, like dancing in the day, dancing in the light, skiing with a guy.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   Nothing to say, up we go and skiing down and up we go and skiing down.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   I was so desperate at four o'clock to keep going when they were closing the lift I tried to bribe the lift operator.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Barney says, "Easy Spauld, easy. You've been skiing for seven hours, man."
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Seven hours? I've never done anything for seven hours in my life except sleep.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Seven hours without thinking of death once?
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Driving back to the condo, Barney was driving. I was flatlining.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   [laughter]
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   We get back to the condo and unwind in front of the gas log.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   [laughter]
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Watch the Weather Channel.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Have a couple of beers and fall into deep, glorious, dreamless, oblivion sleep.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   The following morning I wake up and I think, "Oh my God, oh my God, now there's skiing and there's life."
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   And I don't want to live anymore.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000]   I don't want to come down off this mountain.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   For the first time in my life I felt this mission, this task, this direction.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   I want to ski across America to New England.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000]   [laughter]
[00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   And this was the plan, that I would book my monologues around ski resorts and work my way across.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Now I knew that I had to be initiated on Ajax, that mountain I'd gone up with Rene, that big father figure monster in Aspen.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And I had to ski there first, so I got a very good booking, Grey's Anatomy, at the Wheeler Opera House in Aspen.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   They gave me, it was a very good setup, they gave me a condo, free lift tickets, some money, equipment, and a free lesson.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Now that time for me in Ajax, with two main mountains in Aspen, Ajax, the great monster father figure,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   and then Buttermilk, the reclining lady, you could ski over her breast and through her thighs,
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   and then go get beat up by the father at the end of the day.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   The ticket was interchangeable, if you know what I mean.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I was going to take my free lesson over at Buttermilk, the reclining lady,
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   and I rent those 160's, little stubby skis, so I can turn easily, and get my free ski lift ticket,
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   and I get over there and I'm waiting for my ski instructor, I'm a little nervous because I have nothing to read,
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   I'm not used to that, so I resort to reading the back of my ski ticket.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Which I will never do again.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   It reads, "Skiing is inherently a dangerous sport which can result in personal injury, including catastrophic injury,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   death, or property damage."
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   God forbid, property damage.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   If you're not willing to assume the risk set forth in this warning, please do not ski in this area.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Sign it, sign my life away, sign, sign, sign, sign, sign, and wait for my ski instructor to come out,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   and out he comes and says, "Hi guy, alright, rock and roll."
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Let's begin, hey, Sterling, right, it's okay if I call you Sterling?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Hey Sterling, let's begin with a little joke.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   You know the difference between a vacuum cleaner and a snowboard?
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   No, I don't.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Depends on where you attach the dirt bag, alright.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   Okay, slight bend in the knees, corresponding bend in the hip joint, good, okay,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   crouch and lift at the same time, fine.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   Skis flat and parallel in the snow, okay, wait.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   90% of your weight on your downhill ski, wait forward, don't sit back,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   nothing natural about this posture, Sterling, nothing natural about it.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   Now, flex your elbows, weight over the balls of your feet, good, don't stick your butt out, alright.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Now, your basic traverse stance is often referred to that as a banana.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   You want to think of your ski suit as a banana skin, fine.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   But think of the banana as arching down the slope.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Angulate, big guy, okay, upright banana, nothing natural about it.
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   You're really falling down the mountain, Sterling, you're really falling down.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Another snowboarder shoots between us, that little fuck.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   Okay, punch your belly button down, banana arching, angulate, big guy, okay.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   Stand there now, you stand still, I'm going to traverse on down, I'm going to stop and you follow.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I stood there like a frozen banana.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   [laughter]
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   Caught a head cold and went down the wheel of opera house to perform Grey's Anatomy.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   My hypochondriacal, ironic voice made all the exhausted skiers laugh.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   [laughter]
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   The following day, I was determined to set my skis on Ajax,
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   even though my guidebook said beginners shouldn't even contemplate the slope.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   On the way to Ajax, remembering my Greek history,
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Ajax, hero of the Trojan Wars, who hallucinated on a flock of sheep,
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   thought they were warriors, killed the sheep, then when he realized they were sheep,
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   killed himself out of shame and humiliation.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   [laughter]
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   That was Ajax.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   So I arrive and I'm trying to, you know, I am trying to choose the easiest slope just by the names on the ski map.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   And I choose Dipsy Doodle and Pussyfoot.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   [laughter]
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   So I'm standing on Dipsy Doodle talking to myself, okay.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   The ski is parallel and slightly apart.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Slightly would be.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   [laughter]
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Relax arms and flex elbows.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Now how do you flex an elbow?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Why did I let him call me Sterling?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   Crouch and lift at the same time.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   [laughter]
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Ninety percent of your weight on your downhill ski?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   Ninety percent.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   [laughter]
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Think of yourself as a banana.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Don't stick your butt out? What ball?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Weight over the balls of your feet.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Now I never knew my feet had balls.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   I've heard the expression, but I've never been able to really contact him.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Basically I felt like this bad geometry class, this fragmented disc joint did not hold at all.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Other skiers are going by me top speed there because they're all doing that little Austrian Vadal they all learned out there.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   That tight ass skis right together, tight ass little bunny hop.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   On your left.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   On your left.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   You are not allowed to fall on Ajax.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   People stick their noses up in the air and go on your left.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   On a buttermilk you fall and say, "How you are, guy? Can I help you?"
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   On Ajax, "On your left."
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000]   And I'm dyslexic.
[00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   So I'm yelling, "Look out!"
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   But I'm skiing.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   I'm skiing down Dimpsy Doodle and Pussyfoot.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   I'm crashing down Ruthie's Run.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   It's a vertical too steep for me.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   I'm wiping out too. Boom, yard sale. But I'm up and I'm skiing.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   And I don't have that inner cheerleader voice yet.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   No shape or form of it.
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   But the voice I no longer have is that self-deprecating "You're shit, you'll never do this" voice.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   Because the mountain's hitting me so hard there's no room for that.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   You see? Boom, boom.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   And all of a sudden I'm skiing and I experience the zen miracle.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   I'm hungry without looking at my watch.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   [laughter]
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   And I think, "Well, you know, I don't have to go all the way down to the base of the mountain."
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   I see a little gourmet restaurant over there, Bonnie's.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   The other skiers are going down to pull in.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   I'm a skier now. I can pull in with them.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   Take my skis off, drive me to snow.
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   Plump on down, big boots topping like a man on the moon out on the deck.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   Stretch out in the sun, order a well-done hamburger to avoid E. coli and relapse.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   Can this be me, Spuddy Gray?
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   The great failure of Barrington, Rhode Island, relaxing in Aspen, Colorado in a skiing industry.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   My God, the fat lady hasn't sung yet.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   Wow, what a night. And this could be my first vacation.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   I'm having a good time and I'm alone without feeling lonely.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   I'm not alone for long, though.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   Here come three people walking toward me and they're smiling as though they know me.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   They must have seen the monologue. I think they know me because of that.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   But I like them. They're locals. The first lady, her name is Maggie.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   She's a male woman.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   You know, a letter carrier.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   [laughter]
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   She's on a long lunch break.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   Her boyfriend is with her, Jake, who's a contractor.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   And then there's Martha, who's a ski instructor for the blind over at Buttermilk.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   She teaches the blind to ski and she's taking a day off.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   And they're all taking a day off and they want to ski with me.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   And I said, "Well, I'm on it, but I'm really not a skier. Thanks.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   I'm just basically a faller up here.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   I'm up here practicing my fall."
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   They laugh, but Jake's got this theory about pack skiing.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   He says, "If you ski with a group of good skiers,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   something to do with Balinese dance masters,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   do they teach their students kinetically?
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   Ah, all right, whatever. I'll give it a try.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   Don't waste this theory on me. All right."
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   [laughter]
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   So I go and get my skis on.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   I always feel too big after lunch. It's like learning how to walk again.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   They're turning like semis.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:50.000]   They're crossing. I crash. I fall. They wait. They laugh.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   But I have to tell you, Jake's theory about pack skiing,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   the mimic actor in me is able to emulate, for some reason, Jake's every move,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   better than any teacher.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   I am starting to ski better by just being close to him.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   The problem is the closer I get to him, the more like him I get,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   and I can't find my way back to myself.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   And I crash trying to get back to myself.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   The other thing that's a little disconcerting or bothering me
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   is that Jake's girlfriend Maggie keeps lighting up a snuffed out marijuana joint
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   every time we go up on the lift and passing it over to all of us.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   And I say, "Don't bother with me. Please. It just makes me think."
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   [laughter]
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Well, actually, thinking's the wrong word.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   I'd be a scholar if that was the case.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   [laughter]
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   What it really does, it muddle heads me.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   Baroque head, fuzzy head, all busy head.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   If I was dancing at a disco, maybe I'd take a talk and dance it off, you know?
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   "But spalding," Maggie says.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   Skiing's like dancing in the day. It's like dancing in the light.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   Don't say no. Just say maybe.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   [laughter]
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   So next time, it's just Maggie and I on the double.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   We end up together, and she passes it over, and I don't even think about it.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   I just take it and go...
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   [blowing]
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   And I begin to think, and I am thinking so hard,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   I forget to get off the lift.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   And it goes around, and they stop it. I'm dangling up here.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   And the lift operator's going, "Rock and roll. Having a good day, guy?
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Whoo! Help him down. All right. Awesome, awesome, awesome."
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   The skis feel too big. They're falling off.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   I think it's the marijuana that's causing them to feel too big,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   but I have to tell you, in defense of the hemp,
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000]   it certainly didn't loosen up my hips that day.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   Not that you're supposed to have loose hips when you're skiing,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   but I sure did that day.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   The other thing it was doing was enabling me,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   but it was very odd for me. I was bonding with Jake.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   That's with the ladies.
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Down below, I'm waiting for them to come up with Jake,
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   and he turns to me and says, "Spoiling. You're doing very well.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   You really are, but I just want to show you something."
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   "Uh-oh. He's going to try to teach me something.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   I'm turning into a frozen banana."
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   [laughter]
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   "No, no, no, no, no. Cooler, cooler, cooler. You're doing well.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   Don't get uptight. You're doing good parallel turns,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   but what happens when you come out of the turn
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   is you're sliding sideways down the slope,
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   and the reason you're sliding sideways down the slope
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   is you're not edging."
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   Look what I do with my skis. I look down.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Jake rolls his skis into the slope.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Jet, "Oh, what a difference an edge makes."
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Now we are skiing down Ruthie's run together,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   a vertical so steep I was crashing down before.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000]   When with this new edging, I understand something.
[00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   You have to be out of control to be in control.
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Just for a second, you are falling down the mountain,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   and then you must believe that you'll come around,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   and up until that day, I doubted everything in my life,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   but I knew that if I doubted that I could turn right,
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   I would not turn right, so it was leap of faith,
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   and I was around, and leap of faith, I was around,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   and leap of faith, I was around, and leap of faith,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   I was around, and Maggie shoots behind me
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   with the stereo earphones on going, "Small thing.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Think of it as a white ball of death."
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   And I'm like, "Oh."
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   [laughter]
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   "Oh, I know if she gets her kicks.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   She wants me to do a monologue about her,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   and she wants to be in it."
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   [laughter]
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   But I keep my balance, and I have a wonderful time,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   and I realize all my life, I've been anxious.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000]   What is anxiety?
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Fear without an object.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   At last, I had the object, this mountain, Ajax,
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   and it was wonderful.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   We had a wonderful afternoon being afraid.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   [laughter]
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   And then Jake says, "Spaulding, time's up.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   You've got to download.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   We're going to run the mountain.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   It's almost 4 o'clock."
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   "What?"
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   "No, you take the Silver Queen down."
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   "I don't know why I'm skiing with you guys."
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   "No, listen.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   You've really done a really good job.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   You're pretty tired.
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   The only way down off the mountain right now
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000]   is Spa Gulch."
[00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   And I don't think you want to go down that, though.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   The locals refer to that around 4 o'clock
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   as the valley in the shadow of death.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   It's icy.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   There are convergence of trails.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   All the skiers are coming into that gulch at once.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   Maggie blew her ACLs out last year.
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   You could hear them sputtering pop
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   like wet spaghetti up the canyon.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   You don't want that to happen to you, do you?
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   No.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   But I want to ski with you guys.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   It's your choice.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   So I line up behind Martha,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   the ski instructor for the blind.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   I hadn't skied with her yet,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   and she takes off like a sleek weasel on her 200s.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   And I'm right behind her.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000]   And now the great joy begins
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   because we've just been skiing like the head of Ajax,
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   the head of the monster.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   And now we're exploring every limb of that body as we go down.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   And I can feel the rhythm now of this long run
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and my body seeding up in my ski suit,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   and the sun is coming through aspens as it's set,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   casting rainbow prisms that break at the edge of the fir trees
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   as we're coming down to the gulch now.
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   I can hear the snowboarders behind me shredding the slope.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   I don't dare turn around.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.000]   And coming into Spa Gulch now, and Martha's ahead of me,
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   and I can see all the other skiers converging like L.A. freeways.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   And all of a sudden, Martha goes down into the mouth of the gulch,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   and she goes up on the wall and hops around and comes down.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   The wall of the gulch into oncoming traffic.
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   And I am behind her.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Am I skiing or are the skis skiing me?
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   And up the wall I go.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   And down I go.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   And up and I see a new moon and a cobalt blue sky.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   And come down into amber light and shadow and ice and moon and sky
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   and amber light and shadow and ice and moon and sky
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   and amber light and shadow and ice and amber light and shadow and ice.
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   Bow!
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Born out of the thighs of Ajax.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   [laughter and applause]
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   And Jake comes over and gives me a big high five.
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   My first.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   [laughter]
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   And I say thank you, thank you, thank you, one and all for running with me today.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   And I bid them farewell and went to take back my rented equipment.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   And I get to the rental shop and the guy says,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   "Hey, man, you should be the debtor in the hospital."
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   I said, "What are you talking about? Did you hear I ran the gulch?"
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   "No, you stole some lawyer's 195s at lunch."
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   "He had a $125 ski lesson he was supposed to take.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:15.000]   He had a ticket on your stubby little edgeless 160s, man."
[00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   "He's looking for you."
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   "Also, you were skiing on the wrong bindings all day.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   You're fucking blessed, man. You're fucking blessed."
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   And with his blessings.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   And with his blessings, I knew now I didn't have to make my way across America to get to New England.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   I didn't have to ski Sun Valley in Jackson Hole because I'd been initiated on Ajax.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   I'd skied Spa Gulch and I'd graduated from 160s to 195s in a day.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   [laughter]
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   But at the bottom of the mountain, I was losing my balance.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   At the top, I was finding it from the parking lot on.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   I was a mess. I was demolitioning my life.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   I don't know why, but I think when a self-destructive impulse is finally turned around and aimed outward,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   it sometimes does something in outside of you.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:25.000]   And I was systematically, consciously, and unconsciously demolishing my relationship with Renee.
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   And not being very clear about it at all, just really acting out.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   We'd been together a long time. I mean, 13 years we met.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   And we met in 1979 back in the old days when you'd go to bed on a first date with each other, and we did.
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   And she had too much to drink, and just as we got into bed, she said,
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   "Excuse me, you're going to have to get up because I'm going to throw up."
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   And I went and got a good, big cooking pot and held it while she filled it up.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   And I think that I equated that with love.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   [laughter]
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   That was the bond. And I think that I tried to make her throw up for the rest of the relationship.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:05.000]   [laughter]
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   I think that in any culture where there are not planned marriages, I was certainly being one,
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   that the attraction initially to another person is really very much on the unconscious.
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   You think you know what it is, but you really don't until you're with that person for a long time.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   And Rene and I were deeply unconscious.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   [laughter]
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   In a profound way.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   And I, looking back, I didn't think the original attraction with these two kids in us that were underdeveloped,
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   staring out through these adult bodies. The two kids that were highly seduced by the parents, Rene's dad,
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   my mom, both having died at 52 of self-destructive causes, left these two kids looking out of these adult bodies.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   And as I got closer to 52, my kid began to beat up Rene's kid and turn her into a mother.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   Now, I, when I got to 52, I can't call it a midlife crisis.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   What happens at 52 is you realize 36 is midlife, and you freak out.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   [laughter]
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   Because at 52, you see the end of the plank that you're walking. Up until then, time is an abstraction.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   But at 52, you realize you've lived longer than you will live.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   You see the abyss. And I thought when that happened, and Rene hoped this would happen too,
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   I'd be a courageous noble mensch with my mortality in the face, you know, act right.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   I didn't, I freaked out, I was an asshole.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   [laughter]
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:32.000]   I'm like the guy at the party, "Oh, the party's coming to an end? Let's drink up! Let's live so hard I was killing myself!"
[00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   And I was breaking down and fragmenting pretty heavily.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Now, I'm a pretty chaotic guy, and usually Rene was able to master and shape all the chaos
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000]   I'd bring to her and help turn into a monologue.
[00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   [laughter]
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   Really, that was the process.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:53.000]   At 52, I began to break down so much she couldn't even find the right personality.
[00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   I mean, I even lost the witness, which I usually have running so I can remember things to tell you.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   So I don't remember a lot of what happened around that period.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   But I do remember at least four personalities that I fragmented into.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   The first I will call the two-year-old, because I've had recent encounters with a two-year-old,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   and I have to tell you, the behavior was similar.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   [laughter]
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   I think there's a theory that two-year-olds have an omnipotent fantasy that they can totally devour and destroy their parents.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   [laughter]
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   And they are so frightened of this that they have to test it out.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   [laughter]
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   I was hitting on Rene, I was testing it out all the time.
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   So there was the two-year-old.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   Then there was a really frightening personality, I call it Mom, my mom.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   And it was frightening because I was starting to act like her.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   And I didn't know whether I was acting, I'm the kind of actor that can play himself,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   if I was playing that being crazy like her, or was I really going crazy?
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:52.000]   Which I guess is a form of being crazy if you don't know the difference.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.000]   [laughter]
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Or it may even have been a more subtle form.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   It may have been a case of, though mentally deranged, not realizing this, wishes to appear so.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   [laughter]
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   You know, when I say my mother was crazy, I mean, her behavior was like a madwoman.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   She tore her hair out from the back of her head, picked at her ears until they bled,
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   cried out to Jesus day and night, sang certain Christian science hymns out of tune.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   [laughter]
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:28.000]   I hadn't reached the point of crying out to Jesus, but I was crying out,
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   in the involuntary, almost like Tourette's way, when I would get so anxious in New York.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   And I think really it was right, the anxiety was about not being able to stop time,
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   because what I would cry out was, "Oh, no, no, wait, wait, just a minute.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:43.000]   No, I can't, I can't, I just, whoa."
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   But no one would notice that in New York.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   [laughter]
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000]   I can remember walking out in the night one time and letting out with a yell, "Wow!"
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:55.000]   And people just echoed it all the way up to Washington Square.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   "Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow."
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   It's like a dominoes.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]   My mother did that once in a supermarket in Rhode Island,
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   and they put her in a straitjacket and gave her shock treatments, you know.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   She'd still be alive today if she lived in New York City.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   [laughter]
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   So there was the two-year-old, there was mom, then there was the performer, who you see now.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   I could go out and put on the Magic Plaid shirt and go out
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   and turn in a performance without yelping once,
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   although I might be barking a bit on the way to the theater.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   "Well, yeah, look out, I can't, ow, ow, ooh, damn it."
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   And people slowing down saying, "Is that Spaulding Gray rehearsing in the streets?"
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   [laughter]
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   So there was the two-year-old, there was mom, there was the performer,
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   and then the fourth personality I remember, I'm calling the 16-year-old,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   because I was having an affair with Kathy now.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   I dropped in and we had more than tea.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.000]   Now, I certainly had affairs when I used to travel out on the road and look forward to it.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:55.000]   I never knew when they were going to happen, they were always a surprise,
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000]   and they were probably the most powerful form of nonverbal communication
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   I've ever experienced in my life, as well as being fun.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   [laughter]
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.000]   Now, Renee had some, but we always, never to the extent that I did,
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:13.000]   because, for lots of different reasons, but we would certainly share it or discuss it,
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.000]   and that defused it, and if she knew about it, then it wouldn't continue and it was out there.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   See, it was never where we lived, the idea of never to bring it home.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Now, the point was that I met Kathy on the road
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   and then she moved to New York City to get a job there,
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   and the odd thing was that she moved to a street called Thomas Street in New York,
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   and I happened to live on a street called Thomas Street in Barrington, Rhode Island,
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   quite a different street, but when I was 16,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   I didn't have a girlfriend because I really, I dated my mother until I was 23.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   [laughter]
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   So in a way, I was going back and regressing and kind of turning Renee into this mother figure
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   and then having Kathy as this girlfriend on the side,
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   and I thought that I could keep it separate and that it was all right
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   and it wasn't going to have any bad consequences and like that.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   Now, why Kathy? Very different, very different. The contrast was amazing.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   Renee and I are two very complicated people.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   All we have to be in a room together would be ten people there.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   [laughter]
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   There would be Renee and I, two so-called adults,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   and then there would be the two children looking out in here.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   Then there would be the two personas that I've created of Renee
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   and Spalding in the monologues over here,
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   and then there would be the two parents, dead parents, like drooling ghosts,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   Renee's father and my mother over here,
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   and then there was the disembodied therapist voices flapping,
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]   like, you know, [laughter]
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   the divisory butterflies in the air. It was amazingly dramatic. It was never a dull moment.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   It was really, really always dramatic.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   And Kathy was totally different. She was from upstate New York.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   She was a country girl. She was a Gemini like me.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   We would go camping and get lost because we're two Geminis,
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   and then we would laugh, actually, at this.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   And I never laughed before with the woman I lived with.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   I lived with two women, two long-term relationships,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   and I made them laugh all the time, but I didn't laugh.
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   And I've always wanted to laugh. I was ready to turn my sexuality in for laughter.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   And I laughed, I think, five times with Kathy when we were seeing each other for two years.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   The other thing was that Kathy was a mother, and looking back on that,
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   I didn't realize how important that was.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   She had a three-year-old daughter, so there was no leftover mothering energy for me.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   I used to get a whiff of that mothering energy, and I would just [slurping noise]
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   Suck it dry. [laughter]
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:39.000]   Now, over the years, Renee and I had clearly come into a fused place in the relationship.
[01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   I really think that loving a person is seeing them over there
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   and accepting them pretty much for who they are.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   And I did love Renee, and I did see her.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   And as she got closer, I began to see a mirror as she became my echo.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   And as she got closer and became my director, it was a unit, a Renee Spalding Ball.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   And I would try to pull away from that.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   And I mean, my mother and I were fused, very fused.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]   Now, how was I going to get away from her?
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   I was going to join the Merchant Marines and go to Bali,
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   but she killed herself first, and that took care of the fusion.
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   My plan was to go to Bali and come back with a big sack of dirty underwear
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   and trinkets and starries, and Mom would greet me at her spuddy boy at the gate
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   with unconditional love, and I thought there was no bag too big and too diffuse
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   that I couldn't bring back and dump in Renee's lap for her to shave.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   And as I was approaching 52, all of this stuff started to happen,
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   and Renee wanted to get married after 13 years together.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   And I thought, I should be able to give her that, absolutely.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   But I had such cold feet about it, I actually proposed to her in front of my therapist,
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   who knew I was having the fair with Kathy and said nothing about it.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   And, in fact, I brought Kathy in to meet him, and afterwards she went in to use his restroom, his toilet,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   and he said, "She is something. She is very much European in her attitude, like a French woman."
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   I said, "We all scallywag. You want to fuck her, don't you?"
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   "No, no."
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   And then he had a very bad countertransference and died of a heart attack
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   before I could kill him.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   All of this was going on, and I was about to get married, and I thought,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   "Well, getting married, maybe we'll just stop the affair.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Maybe that's how you stop affairs. You get married."
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   So we went out, and we were going to rent a house in the Hamptons,
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   so we were going to get married, and everything was going forward.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   And, again, out there, you had to go very early to rent a house in the Hamptons.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   You had to go in February to get a house in the August.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   And I had this very powerful, cryptic dream that I will never forget.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   A footnote to the dream.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   After my mother killed herself, my father had her cremated
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   and scattered her ashes over Narragansett Bay.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   And in this dream, I woke up. I had been sleeping on ashes.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   And I was naked, and the ashes had been filtering up into my naked flesh,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   with the flesh going into the ashes.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   There was no boundary.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   And I thought, "Ashes? What were they shaped like?"
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   And the answer quickly came, "A sleeping bag."
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   And I went, "A sleeping bag? What do you mean a sleeping bag?"
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   And the answer came, "You know, a mummy bag."
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   I thought, "Ah, this is the dream."
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   And I went ahead and got married.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   And when I got married, as soon as I got married,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   it was like a cork going on the bottle that I was in.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   And I went, "Air! Air! Air!"
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   And the affair heated up with Kathy. It didn't die down. It heated up.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   And when Kathy told me she was pregnant,
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   I fell down on the floor and went into a fetal position.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   And when I got up, I said, "Get rid of it. Get rid of it."
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:59.000]   She said, "Not so fast. I'm going to think about this one.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   If I decide to have this child, I will raise it,
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   but I must have time to think about it."
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   And I got out of there.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   I put on my magic plaid shirt and went out on tour.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   I gave her money for an abortion.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   I called. I wrote. I called. She said, "I'm still thinking."
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   And on September 27, 1992, Kathy gave birth to a son
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   and named him Forrest Dylan Gray.
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   This was extremely traumatic.
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   Renee cried. I cried. Kathy cried. Forrest cried.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   We all cried big time in our own ways.
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   And Renee requested/forbid me to see this child
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   until there was some reconciliation between us.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   And I put on my magic plaid shirt
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   and went out this time for a tour of California.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   And when I finished, I ended up in San Francisco
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]   and was unable to leave the hotel room.
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   I got very agoraphobic, and Renee called and said,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   "You've got to come back.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   I have seen Kathy on the street with the baby in the snugly,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   and I am in bed wiped out from this."
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   And I said, "You've got to give me a day."
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   She said, "If you take a day, I can't be here for you anymore."
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   And I took two days.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   I think I took two days because I couldn't find myself to get out of the room.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   The two images were so split of me sitting.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   It had to be one or the other, sitting by Renee, comforting her in the bed
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   or standing out on the street beside Kathy meeting my son for the first time.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:29.000]   And my friends felt I had to go back.
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   They took three to drag me out of the hotel room.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   "Well, I can't. Oh, I have to just write something in my book.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Oh, wait, another cup of coffee."
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   "Oh, no, no, no."
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   This time, the captain of the American Airlines came out and said,
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   "I don't care who this man is.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   Do you know what it costs to land this plane in Kansas?
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   We can't have him on."
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   And somehow, my friend Bill convinced the captain of that airline
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   that I was really only rehearsing for a psychotic role in a Martin Scorsese movie.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   And American Airlines let me on.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   I was, "Oh, look out!"
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   People were moving away from me.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   I should not have been on that flight.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   Very anxious.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   And I get back, and Renee was clear.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   She said, "That's it. I'm moving out to stay with a friend.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.000]   We're going to have a separation."
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   And I did not throw myself in front of her.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   When the door closed to the loft, I sat there, and I turned to a stone thing.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   I was a statue of myself, felt nothing, a dead thing.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   And I took a bottle of vodka and took a couple of big petal vodka shots
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   and felt my breath and thought, "Well, that's it.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   I don't know what I feel," because for 13 years, Renee's heart had filled the room.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   She was all heart.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   And if my feeling wasn't there, the room was filled with hers.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   If I didn't know what I wanted to do next, a five-year plan appeared.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   There was no space.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   I had never had the space.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   And now I'm sitting there thinking, "What do I want to do?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   If there's anything I want to do, what would it be?"
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   And I thought, "I think I want to see my son.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   It's been eight months he's been in the world."
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   And I called Kathy, and I said I was coming down.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   And she took him out of the crib, and he went right for her breast.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   And I knew there was no need for a blood test.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   I saw the back of my father's head and his head.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   I saw the shape of it.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   I saw my brother Rocky's eyes and his eyes.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   I saw a distant mirror.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   I saw a little lust flower.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   I saw a completely formed human being.
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:39.000]   I saw a glorious accident.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]   And I experienced a perfect paradox at that point.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   I thought, "Now I can die, and I must stay alive to help this little guy through."
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.000]   And Kathy put him in my arms and said, "Go take him.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   Go off to your summer house and bond with him.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   You haven't seen him yet in eight months."
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   "What? You're giving me this infant to go off with?"
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   She said, "I'll catch up with you. I'll be up later."
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   And I went.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   I had no idea on the train going up to Bristol North what forests look like.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   Do they look good, bad, what?
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   All the people coming up and saying, "Oh my goodness, what a lovely granddaughter you have."
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   [laughter]
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   And I got up to Brewster.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   I got to the house.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   I didn't know what to do with him.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   I put him down like a hamster or rug rat or whatever.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   I'm going to do my thing, make my Bloody Mary and get out the dinner, a salmon, green peas.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   And at some point, I had to put everything aside and go down to change his diaper.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   And he was on his back, and I looked down, and I was not ready for this.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   I fell into his eyes.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   Coming back at me was this absolute pure gaze.
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   His eyes were totally still.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   They were not -- it wasn't old or young because his eyes weren't even timed.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   It was like mere being, pure consciousness coming back at me.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   I mean, non-agenda eyes.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   [laughter]
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   Not judging, not needing, not hurting, not tempting, not touching, just eyes.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:10.000]   And I stared for the longest time until I pulled back and blinked.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   I couldn't deal with it.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   And I took him in my arms, and we were inseparable for five hours.
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:20.000]   In my lap, he sat while I ate, pulling chewed green peas out of my mouth and feeding himself.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   And the image came to me of Mother Bird, Mother Robin.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.000]   What if I spit the peas in his mouth?
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   [laughter]
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   And I took his little mouth and held it and went to spit the peas and pow!
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   He straight on me.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Wow!
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   Boundaries in eight months.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   Where would he learn that?
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   I could learn something from this little guy.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   I would have thrown my head back and gone, "Feed me, feed me."
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   I took him in my arms and put a Bob Dylan CD on and opened the door and went out and spun in the front yard.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   And the centrifugal force took his little body out, and then something reversed it.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   And I felt it pull in and press up against my chest.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   And I felt our hearts click up.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   And I thought, "Oh, yes, 'til death do us part."
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   This little innocent Archimedes had the fulcrum strong enough to split the fusion, a fusion I never dreamed I once split, between Renee and me.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   A fusion no woman back then could have split because often and always there was another woman there or there or over there.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   But there was never just another son.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   I would never say, "Who? Hey, look at that son."
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   [laughter]
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   "Look at the tush on that son."
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   [laughter]
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   So I was going out on tour again, and I invited my new family configuration, Kathy, her daughter Marissa, and our son, Horace, to move into my log.
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   I never would have done that if I wasn't going out on a major tour.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   I mean, I just, I had courage.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   I never expect to come back from these tours.
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   USAS 737.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   I am always so surprised when the plane touches down on the tarmac.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   And oh, was I surprised this time.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   There was no need to make up impingencies or new crises or drama when I arrived at my loft.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   It was like a ship in a storm.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   Kathy's running around like a female ship's captain trying to control the chaos.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   Her daughter Marissa is jumping up seeing improvised opera, improvising her whole life story in her own opera.
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   Indifferent to my celebrity or my fame.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   Our son, Horace, jumps up naked on my writing desk and takes a shit.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   [laughter]
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:35.000]   What? How am I going to write? I thought this was going to go on for years.
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]   I didn't know it was a phase he passed through that day.
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:40.000]   [laughter]
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   And there was this new configuration going around like a Christmas tree circuit breaker light.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Before, I'd always known just a one-on-one relationship and never was very good at that.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   But now it was shifting. The love was shifting all the time.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   I love Forrest's sister, Marissa, for the way that she loved her brother, Forrest, my son.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   I love my son, Forrest, for the way that he loved Kathy, his mother, and turned her into a mother before I could.
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   So there was time to learn to know her and love her for the woman that she is.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   And it was a new soup. And I wanted to bring this soup home to, to, to, to, to, to what?
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   To my family? What was left of it?
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   My father died three days after I saw my son for the first time.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   His first grandson died.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:23.000]   And I didn't even know he was in the hospital.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   My stepmother did not tell me because she was so angry with me for the way that I portrayed her in my book, "Impossible Vacation."
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   [laughter]
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   I changed her name.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   [laughter]
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.000]   But she recognized the details.
[01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   [laughter]
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   She was so angry that she tried to arrange the memorial service to my father.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   It was my father's day, I couldn't make it, and I was able to cancel something or change a gig, and I made it.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.000]   And I was very glad to be there.
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:58.000]   Both my brothers, Channing and Rothwell, did beautiful, read beautiful eulogies they'd written.
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   I wanted to say something. I had nothing written.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   I wanted to speak a memory of my dad and did get up and told the story of the last time I'd seen him.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   When he was 79, he died when he was 81.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   And I'd seen him because I was going back to revisit Rhode Island.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   I was off to Block Island, Rhode Island to run a workshop for Kids from Hell's Kitchen in New York, a theater workshop.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   And I asked my father if he would pick me up at the train station in Kingsford, Rhode Island
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   and drive me to the ferry in Galilee to go out to Block Island. We'd have a chance to visit.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.000]   Oh, sure.
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   So he picks me up at the station and we have that obligatory bundle of wire hug, you know.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   [laughter]
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   And we ride in silence.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   "Nothing to say," he says. "No one's left. His best man died last week. They're all gone now."
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   He and his wife and my stepmother don't even read the obituaries anymore.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   And as we get closer to the Galilee ferry, all of a sudden my father says, "You know, Rock Chan's Bud?"
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   [laughter]
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:19:00.000]   Whenever my father would forget which son he was with, he would just speak all three names to cover his face.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   [laughter]
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   "You know, Rock Chan's Bud, I was thinking, if we missed that ferry, we'd have a beer together at my summer cot."
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:11.000]   Every son of my father and stepmother would rent a cottage by the sea and never use it.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   Never. It was like an idea.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   [laughter]
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   And he wanted to go there. I said, "Dad, let's miss the ferry."
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:18.000]   "What do you mean?"
[01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   I said, "I can get another in an hour or two."
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   He does a U-turn and we head for the summer cottage.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   He opens it for the first time that summer, gets out the cocktail munchies.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   They're all fog-bound and wilted cheese doodles and little white peanuts, you know, like those styrofoam nuts
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   and little cans of Budweiser, you know, not my favorite beer and not my favorite size can.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:42.000]   [laughter]
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   But it's a drink with Dad.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:50.000]   We go out to the picnic table, out back, and there's this heavy Rhode Island August fog coming in,
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   like the opening of a Eugene O'Neill play.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   [laughter]
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   "Boo-hoo!"
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:58.000]   [laughter]
[01:19:58.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   "Boo-hoo!"
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   You know, Dad, it's good we took this time to have a little chat.
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   I haven't really talked since I was 14.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   [laughter]
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   You told me the facts of life on a golf course.
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   You know, I'm wondering, here you're almost 80.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:18.000]   Do you have any regrets, looking back over your life, major regrets?
[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   I mean, I'm asking you this because I myself feel that I'm ruled by regrets sometimes.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   Does any regret haunt you?
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   No?
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   [laughter]
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   Just that I never climbed Mount Katahdin?
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   "Boo-hoo!"
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   [laughter]
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   "Boo-hoo!"
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   You know, Grant Gray once said that you and Mom were married on Halloween.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   You know, it was Halloween that you got married in a white church in Barrington?
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   Is that true, Dad?
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   I mean, what a kinky imaginative kind of weird day to get married on.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Why Halloween?
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   Seemed like as good a day as any?
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   [laughter]
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   You know, I've never had any children and I don't know why.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   You've had three. How courageous of you.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   I mean, what would you get back from it?
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   I don't know if I can't have them, don't want them, afraid to lose the child in me.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   Well, why, Dad? Why'd you do it?
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   That was the thing that was done in those days.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   [laughter]
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   Oh, well, I won't bother you anymore.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   Oh, one last question, Dad.
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:25.000]   You had three sons, three boys, I'm the middle one.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:29.000]   Dad, why is it that I'm the only one that wasn't circumcised?
[01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   [laughter]
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:33.000]   You weren't.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   [laughter]
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   Well, we better get going. Yeah, wrap it up. Let's get going. Yeah.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   [laughter]
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   We get outside the cottage and he realizes he's got to call Sis, my stepmother, his wife,
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   to find out what kind of fish to buy at the Galilee fish market to bring back for dinner.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   And he goes, "Oh, shit, I forgot to call Sis."
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   And he goes in and I think, "My father never said shit in front of me in his life.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:00.000]   We must have just bonded."
[01:22:00.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   And he comes out and I realize I've left my Danish school bag in there
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   and I go, "Oh, shit, I left my Danish school bag in there."
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   And I realize we had bonded.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   Those two shits made all the difference.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000]   And I told this story at my father's memorial service.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   And afterwards, my stepmother said to me, "You're crazy.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   You're on drugs.
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:30.000]   Your father never said that word in his life.
[01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   Don't you ever come back to Rhode Island as long as you live."
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   So I wasn't about to bring my new family back.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   I pictured her at the Rhode Island border with a pith helmet on, two barbecue forks in her hand.
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   But I thought, "I want to bring my son back to New England. Why am I so obsessed with Rhode Island?
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   Give it up. Kathy has family in New England up in Vermont.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   Her sister's a ski instructor at Stowe. We'll end it through the northern route."
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   [laughter]
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:54.000]   Really.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   A family that skis together might just stay together.
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   And there was snow up there, so here was the plan.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000]   We would bring Forrest back.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   Now, I was going to go in a day early so I could make that triumphant re-entry to New England on skis
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   and then the family would join me.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   So I get up there. I can't find a place to stay.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   The only place that's got a room is a butternut or buttermilk inn.
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   I don't know. It's like a Republican rest home.
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   [laughter]
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   It's like it was built in 1776 yesterday, you know?
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:26.000]   Colonial clapboards, vinyl siding, those little Ethan Allen beds, narrow beds, steam heat I couldn't turn off.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   So I got the window wide open. It's hot air, cold air.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   I wake up. I stagger down.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.000]   All I can see is the ghost of Mom snapping up the shades saying,
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   "Good morning, Spuddy dear. This is the day the Lord hath made.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:39.000]   Let us rejoice and be happy in it."
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   And I'm trying to be happy in it.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.000]   I am staggering down. I mean, the waitresses are running around like Betsy Ross Gone with the Wind theme park dolls.
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:48.000]   [laughter]
[01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   They've got so much ruffle on you can't tell the bed from the breakfast.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.000]   [laughter]
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   Other skiers are wandering around the all-you-can-eat smorgasbord like some ambalistic J. Crew models.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   And I'm downing six cups of that generic coffee to get me out of my chair.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   And I stagger out into damp, flat, cold New England.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   What are you doing back? Remember, you're a skier now. You come back to ski.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]   They've had 18 snowstorms. Vermont is depressed.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   The snow is all crusty and brown at the side of the road.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   It's a flat like Mount Mansteel.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]   There's a low dome, not like a jagged peak of the west.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   And the tangled trees, no aspens with sun coming through.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   Ooh, tangled trees, crucible trees.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   Oh, Mary Warren trees.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:34.000]   Oh, Mary Warren dancing naked around a cauldron tossing a frog in a pot tree.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   [laughter]
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:42.000]   As I drive, and 18 snowstorms have left the lift operators depressed.
[01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   They look like Department of Public Works workers.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   They're dressed in black with orange caution bars.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   No high five, no rock and roll.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   No, not there.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   They don't even check your lift tickets, they're so depressed.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:56.000]   As I go up on the lift and the first thing that occurs to me is,
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   whoa, wait a minute, fear of slow lift thoughts.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   [laughter]
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   This place is a place for me.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   It has a history unlike the west.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.000]   As I go up looking out over Johnny Walker home for the holidays,
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   Ethan Allen, Ethan Fromm Hill.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.000]   [laughter]
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:18.000]   Down below I see there's no condos, I like that.
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   The ski lodge is like a big old log cabin.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   And further up now in the distance I see a working farm,
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   in a barn tucked over there in a snowdrift.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:29.000]   This place was a place before it was a resort, and still is.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   And further up now, higher up, I see in the distance the village of Stowe,
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   like a Norman Rockwell monopoly town.
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   And there is the white church steeple reminding me of the one mom and dad
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   got married in at Halloween.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]   And I recollect the photographs of the honeymoon, that moose hunt in Maine.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   [laughter]
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.000]   And now I have an image of dad, a memory of him in his vegetable garden.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   It's 4th of July and he's picking green peas.
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   Beside him, mom is kneeling in her flower garden, raking it.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   And there, five of us together in harmony.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   No idea of could be or somewhere else, the west, no.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   Just there, in the seasons going around like a circle,
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   giving us our whole way of being, our whole moods.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]   A circle, not a line.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   And in the memory now of that Christmases together,
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:17.000]   seventeen of us at the big table, and now that last Christmas.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000]   The one that mom, who had taken me by the hand and led me to beauty
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   and pointed to beauty, had taken herself out of the world.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   No longer there and no one's picking up her except my brother Rocky,
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   who's had too much to drink, and saying, "What about mom?
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Doesn't anyone want to talk about her today?"
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   And my grandmother's saying, "Oh, she's in heaven now, dear.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:36.000]   She's better off there."
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   And my grandfather's saying, "Don't speak of that today.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   Not a word."
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   And Rocky getting so drunk now that I had to take him out behind the house
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:46.000]   to air his head.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   And there, and it's a construction site behind my grandfather's house,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   I see a dump truck, and there I see the key in the ignition.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   And I help Rocky in and show him how to start it.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   And I aim him at my grandfather's house like a terrorist bomber.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.000]   And off he roars in the dump truck, grazing the white picket fence,
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.000]   shaving the willow tree, and ramming into the azaleas by the house,
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   my grandfather and grandmother doing their heart attack dance in the window.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]   Lift that bar.
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   These lifts have safety bars on them in the east.
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]   And I'm off, and it's, "Oh, sugar and ice, corn snow.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]   Oh, flat light, mashed potatoes.
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]   Whoop, this is wet. Boom, I'm back on my ass.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.000]   It's wet, and I'm up, and I've got my balance, and it's crud rough.
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.000]   Can't see anything with my bad eye.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   Shub-a-boom-boom, ra-ba-ba-ba-ba-boom.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000]   Shub-a-boom-boom-boom.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:30.000]   Ba-boom.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   What was that?
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]   Sixteen minutes up, three minutes down.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   Nothing to do but go up again. That's what I'm here for.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   I'm here to ski.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   Hey, I think I'll ride with a guy in the lift this time for a little company.
[01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   He's not going to talk to me. I don't have to talk to him.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.000]   I'm not afraid of silence.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   And the silence turns to sadness.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   Not a depression, but a sadness.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   And a big one, and I think, you know, you can let it go.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   You don't have to hold on to it.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000]   Let go of the memories. Let go of the memories of that beautiful California day,
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   skiing with Barney in that bright light.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:16.000]   You're here now in Vermont alone. Let it go.
[01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:22.000]   Let go the memory of Renee and the remorse you feel for how you treated her
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:28.000]   and how her bright lights will never, never shine on you again.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   Let that one go.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   Let go the memory of Mom and Mom's madness.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   Let go the sadness of Dad dying alone,
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000]   me not beside him with his first grandson.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   And another realm of sadness peels off me and drops down like a great,
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.000]   great gossamer web and settles on the snow below.
[01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:51.000]   And I think, no one really knows anything.
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   No one is watching us. No one is watching over us.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:59.000]   And I will die, and you will die.
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   And one by one, all the stars will go out of the sky.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:07.000]   And lift that bar. Ah, the wonderful impingencies of snow.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]   Oh, my goodness, look, this mountain has a personality.
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   There's a big patch of blood over there. It's not mine.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000]   And I love the way this thing has no bowls.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   It's like white river rafting, discovering the mountain.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   It's like I'm on Upper Lord, down to Center Line.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   Now Center Line is very steep. Someone just crashed next to me.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   It's not me. I'm still up.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.000]   And now, down into Middle Lord, I'm skiing by the trees.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   Why is it that the trees give dimension to the snow?
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]   The light is not as flat. I have to ask someone.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:34.000]   And down now into Lower Lord, I'm doing wide GS turns.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   No rush to get down. Just back and forth and falling back on my skis.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:40.000]   It's a perfect ACL-ripping move, but my knees are fine.
[01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   I find my balance, and I'm up, and I'm down.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   And I like it. I like this mountain.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   I go and I meet Karen for lunch, Kathy's sister.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:49.000]   I'm supposed to get some ski lessons from her,
[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]   have a well-done hamburger, talk with her.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   She says she's too busy. We'll work again another day.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:56.000]   Go out and practice carving your turns.
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:58.000]   So I go into the men's room to take a whiz.
[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:00.000]   I'm looking at the guy next to me, which I rarely do,
[01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   but what the hell is he wearing?
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   It looks like a plastic bag with water on it.
[01:30:04.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   And he turns to me and says, "Gobbage bag weather."
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   I go outside. It's raining.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:12.000]   People are skiing down the slope in garbage bags.
[01:30:12.000 --> 01:30:15.000]   They're flapping like plastic flags in the wind.
[01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:19.000]   I think, "Wow, think of that in Aspen."
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000]   I like this place.
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.000]   I'm skiing in a garbage bag.
[01:30:26.000 --> 01:30:28.000]   I'm skiing in the rain in the garbage bag.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.000]   I've never done anything in the rain in my life,
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   and I'm doing it in a garbage bag.
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:36.000]   And I'm paying to do it.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:38.000]   [laughter]
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   Of course, we experienced all the elements that day.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.000]   You know, the rain turns to ice, except sun.
[01:30:44.000 --> 01:30:46.000]   And to celebrate, at the end of the day,
[01:30:46.000 --> 01:30:48.000]   I go in for a beer to the wonderful little English pub
[01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:50.000]   up there called Fox in the House.
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   It looks like a tornado hit it in England,
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   brought over with all the beer and people still in it.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000]   [laughter]
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:30:57.000]   There's a Scottish ski instructor there
[01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:59.000]   drinking a nut-brown ale. He's got a kilt on.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   He's come in early because he's--
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   you see Star Trek, actually.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000]   His name is Scotty, and he's a Trekkie.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   [laughter]
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:08.000]   And he has a kilt on.
[01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.000]   He claims he has no underwear under it,
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   and he says, "It's an inspiration, laddie,
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   when that oyster flays up and tickles your boner."
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   [laughter]
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:18.000]   And over here, there's an old man
[01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   playing chess with a young boy.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:22.000]   Over here, there's a guy smoking a pipe
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:24.000]   reading Ralph Waldo Emerson essays.
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   "Two ladies having tea,
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:29.000]   a bartender speaking in complete sentences."
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000]   [laughter]
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   This is it, my new New England clubhouse.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.000]   I've come home.
[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:39.000]   Now, the following day, Kathy arrives with the family.
[01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   So it's Marissa, our son, Forrest,
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:43.000]   and so the plan is this.
[01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.000]   Forrest goes into daycare because he's 18 months.
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.000]   Marissa is six, and she and I are not getting along
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   at that time because, well, basically,
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   we're both, you know, self-indulgent drama queens.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   [laughter]
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000]   But she's six years old. She's allowed to do it.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:59.000]   [laughter]
[01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   The other thing was that we were both learning--
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:03.000]   we were both quite competitive, not only for her mother,
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   but also we were learning to ski,
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:07.000]   so all we'd have to do is standing next to each other,
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   and we'd just crash into each other like we had bad--
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   [laughter]
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   Marissa would ski across the back of my skis and fall
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:16.000]   and go, "Mommy, Mommy, he did it again!"
[01:32:16.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   [laughter]
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:20.000]   "How am I ever going to make a living?"
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:26.000]   [laughter]
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   Here's the plan.
[01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.000]   Marissa will go off with Kathy's sister, Karen,
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000]   and we'll instruct her how to ski.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   She's very good.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   Her husband and I get together.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   That means Kathy and I get to ski together,
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   but I am in a mopey, foul mood.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:37.000]   I've been up there too long with no sun.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:39.000]   I say I'm suffering from SAD.
[01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:41.000]   That's where the sadness is coming from.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.000]   I know it's a disease.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:46.000]   I said I looked it up in the Mayo Family Clinic disease book.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:47.000]   It's there.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:49.000]   [laughter]
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:32:51.000]   And also, you can learn to ski in New England,
[01:32:51.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   you can learn to ski anywhere,
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]   and you won't be able to wait to get anywhere for a second.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   She says, "Spaul, please, you have a good life.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:00.000]   "Be thankful.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.000]   "Be thankful it's not raining."
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   Begins to rain.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:04.000]   [laughter]
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   "Be thankful it's not cold."
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   It gets cold.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   "Be thankful it's not windy."
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.000]   You know, it's like the new New England prayer.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:13.000]   "Be thankful for what hasn't happened yet."
[01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.000]   [laughter]
[01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   But I have to say, thanks to the rain,
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   there's no one on the slope.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000]   It's quite empty that day,
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000]   and the weather person is saying snow at 1,000 feet,
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:24.000]   and damn it all if they're not right.
[01:33:24.000 --> 01:33:27.000]   That lift gets up to 1,000 feet, and the rain turns to snow.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:29.000]   It's like a seventh-grade science project.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.000]   [laughter]
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:32.000]   Wow.
[01:33:32.000 --> 01:33:34.000]   [laughter]
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:37.000]   And I get up to the top, and I experience, for me,
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   now my favorite skiing conditions.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]   It's a new snow with a light wind,
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]   so you're making new tracks each time you come up,
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.000]   and fresh snow.
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   No longer the grinding sound of ice under our skis,
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:51.000]   just the cozy squeak of skis on new snow.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   Kathy ahead of me skiing ever so gracefully
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   in faded dungarees and a garbage bag.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   [laughter]
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   And pulling in, stopping for no reason
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:02.000]   just to look out over the landscape.
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:05.000]   Me pulling in beside her, feeling no sadness now
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]   in the sound of the wind.
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:10.000]   The purple birches, a purple hue lit from a milky sun
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:12.000]   trying to break through great clouds.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000]   And I pull in beside Kathy and look out over landscape.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.000]   No story, no mirror.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:22.000]   Landscape.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:24.000]   And at the end of the day of skiing,
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   we go over to Spruce Peak finally to join her sister
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   and her daughter for the final family configuration,
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   a run together down Spruce Peak.
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:34.000]   And it's as though the geometry class
[01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.000]   has come home to the slope.
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:38.000]   It's this triangle, an upside down triangle.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:42.000]   There at the base or the top, Kathy and her sister Karen.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:44.000]   In the middle, Kathy's daughter Marissa
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:46.000]   triangulated in snow plow, and I'm at the point.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   And we begin to go down the slope in this configuration.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   And I find enough balance to turn and look over my shoulder,
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]   and there behind me is Kathy's daughter Marissa
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:57.000]   having learned in one day to do a beautiful downhill snow plow.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]   Her ski poles held high, this great gleaming face.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]   And I just yell, out of me comes this voice
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   I have never heard before.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]   Go for it, Marissa, you're great.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]   You're doing beautifully.
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:10.000]   Where did that inner cheerleader's voice come from?
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000]   Where did that non-ironic voice come from?
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]   I have never heard it directed at me,
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]   nor I've heard it come out of me.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.000]   A burst of sun comes out on the family configuration
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.000]   as we come in.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]   They all rush off to get far as to take it.
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:26.000]   I want to go up again for one last run,
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   because now I'm experiencing good-lived thoughts.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:33.000]   As I go up, I'm thinking, with that new inner cheerleader voice,
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:36.000]   I might be able to stop the monologues
[01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:38.000]   and become a ski instructor for children.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:44.000]   I could live in one place, have a private life,
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:47.000]   not have to tour, so I want to try the voice out.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]   I see a little boy ahead of me snow plowing.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]   He's about eight years old, and I just yell behind him,
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]   "Go for it, guy! You're great!"
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]   He turns and crashes down.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:58.000]   I help him up. I apologize.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:01.000]   I go in. The whole family is watching the Weather Channel.
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:04.000]   Oh, my God, the huge storm is coming.
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:06.000]   It's the 19th snowstorm.
[01:36:06.000 --> 01:36:08.000]   Kathy's out of there. She's got to get Marissa back to school.
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   She has to go back to work. She's getting forest out.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000]   They leave me behind, ski bum that I think I am, for the big one.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   It's April 1st, and it's 15 degrees below a wind chill.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.000]   No one says that. On the slope, it's a Monday.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:24.000]   I am blown out of the gondola across boilerplate ice
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:27.000]   into this heavy powder. I don't know how to ski it.
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]   I'm blinded. The skis turn up.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]   I'm going down the slope backwards like an old-time movie.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   I correct them. I hit a big pile of snow,
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.000]   and it sprung from the skis into what is like an open snow grave.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:41.000]   An exhausted lying there, I'm getting covered over
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   like a kid in his snow suit, and I think,
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:46.000]   "This would not be a bad way to go."
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]   To fall asleep forever in powder?
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]   Better than the old age home I'd ever been in.
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]   But get up, Spalding. You're young yet.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:56.000]   Dig the ski out, man. You have children below.
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   It takes 20 minutes to find the ski,
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:00.000]   and now it's whiteout conditions.
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   I can't tell the difference between the sky and the snow or the slope,
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]   except my red skis, which are a boundary.
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   I'm exhausted and frightened now from this whiteout.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   I'm coming in at the end of the day.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:13.000]   And there in front of me, I see -- I do it as a man immediately.
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   He's dressed in yellow. He looks like a displaced fisherman.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]   You know, the oilcloth, top and bottom.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   And he is doing these great, beautiful, wide GS turns,
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   like Tai Chi turns in this heavy powder.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000]   And I fall in behind him at a distance where I can emulate his every move.
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   So he becomes my unconscious teacher.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000]   He's teaching me without knowing, and I'm following.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]   And halfway down the slope, I pull in beside him and see, I'm amazed.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:43.000]   He's in his 70s easily, but with dancing eyes.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000]   And I say, "Thank you for the lesson."
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:50.000]   And he goes, "My pleasure. I didn't know you were behind me. How's it going?"
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:54.000]   And I said, "To tell you the truth, I don't know whether I'm having a good time
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:58.000]   or I'm trying to kill myself."
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:38:03.000]   He says, "When you find yourself in that place, that's when you know you're alive."
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:08.000]   And I bid him farewell, knowing that I've both seen a human being
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.000]   and an apparition, a ghost of my future.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   I, too, could be skiing like that at 70 if I kept it up with my son beside me if he wanted to.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   In skiing in at the end of the day, I realized I'd come back to an old place in a new way.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:27.000]   I'd come back thinking I was going to self-destruct, and I helped bring new life into the world.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   And I gave myself a high five.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]   And I thought, "You've returned, Spalding.
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.000]   You've returned to New England, and you're no longer a Puritan.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   If you define a Puritan as someone who's haunted by the sneaky suspicion
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.000]   that someone, somewhere else, is having a good time."
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   Thank you for coming.
