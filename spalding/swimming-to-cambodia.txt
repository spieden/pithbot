[00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:53.080]   So, I told Rene that I would come back from Thailand and join her in Crumville.
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:01:02.640]   As soon as I had a perfect moment, or on July 8th, whichever came first in time.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.560]   I was certain that I could carry this off, and then things got a little shaky,
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.160]   because I realized I had an open ticket for the airlines.
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:19.360]   An open airlines ticket, and the last time I had an open ticket was in 1976 when I was in India,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.160]   and I was almost hospitalized for not being able to make up my mind.
[00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.120]   But now, I thought I'd grown up, you see.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.960]   I thought I'd matured and developed my choice maker.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.480]   Same thing happened again.
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.240]   I'm in Thailand, and I think, "How many times am I going to be in Thailand in my life?
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.720]   Really, now that I'm over this part of the world, I really should go to China."
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.120]   And then I pictured myself while trying to hitchhike through China,
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.680]   and I thought I'd probably be stuck in the cities, and I'd have to just be another tourist.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.200]   And maybe, "Oh, wait a minute, let's see, it'd be hot there.
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.520]   Maybe I should go on up to the mountains up there in Nepal."
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.800]   I pictured myself up there, hiking through the mountains,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.080]   and I thought I'd be a little landlocked.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.640]   Maybe down in Bali, and I pictured myself down there.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.280]   So, I was kind of going on the China-Nepal-Bali triangle, bouncing in my mind.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   And all the time, I kept taking my ticket to Barbara, who was in charge of transportation for the film.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   I'd say, "Barbara, I was thinking of China.
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.960]   She was sporting, "Listen, now, look at it this way.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.360]   You've got to go back to Bangkok and get a visa if you're going to China.
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.400]   It's just not as simple as that.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.640]   And furthermore, I think you ought to take the ticket yourself and make your own decision.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.440]   It's just the eighth time you've come to me after all."
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.080]   So, Rene was a little nervous.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.160]   You could see that I was beginning to fluctuate and getting on shaky ground.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.480]   But I had seen, you see, and I had an idea, really, where I wanted to go.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.360]   We had videotapes in the art department that we could see any time we wanted
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.000]   to do research about Cambodia or the invasion, the Khmer Rouge, Cambodia Year Zero.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.240]   But one of these tapes, you may have seen on public television, was called Going Back,
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.040]   about four veterans, a videotape of four veterans, Vietnam, American Vietnam veterans,
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.400]   that went back Christmas of '81 to Hanoi for the first time.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.760]   And they'd gone over once before originally to kill people.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.480]   And now they were going back to make friends, you see.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.360]   And one of these vets was Tom Bird, who was in the film The Killing Fields with Me.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.720]   He was doing a small role and also giving advice to help make things authentic.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.440]   And Tom was in this videotape.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.080]   Tom is the head of the Vietnam Veterans Ensemble, Theater Ensemble in New York.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.520]   And I saw this tape and I thought, now that Hanoi, I was so impressed by it.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.240]   It was fantastic.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.280]   I mean, it was a lot of other stuff on the tape.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.920]   It was incredible, too, the Amerasian children in the streets, which are very beautiful,
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.240]   the people who are suffering from Agent Orange in the hospitals.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.840]   But what really took my attention was the fact
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.280]   that the entire city of Hanoi was filled with bicycles.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   There were no cars, you see.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.720]   All you could hear was the sound of wind in the spokes.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.120]   And I thought, that's where I want to go for my vacation.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.120]   You know, I won't be a tourist there.
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.920]   I was beginning to feel more and more like a little drummer girl, you see.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.480]   I wanted to really become this kind of foreign correspondent,
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.520]   this actor turned real foreign correspondent.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.840]   And I went to Tom Bird and I said, "Tom, what are our chances of going?"
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:10.920]   He said, "I think we could will it if we put our minds to it.
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.840]   And I think we should first start with visiting the Vietnamese Embassy."
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.000]   Now, I visited the American Embassy, a number of us had.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.800]   I was very intimidated by that because of the huge central air conditioning.
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.520]   I couldn't feel where the draft was coming from.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.200]   There was no sense of it.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.040]   It was just like being in this cool glass block, flame trees out the window,
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.040]   wall to wall carpeting, and this great kind of a ship's captain of an ambassador.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.400]   Now, the Vietnamese Embassy was quite a different thing.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.840]   It was just down the road from the American Embassy.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.800]   And it was very much like a, well, if I had to describe it,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.840]   I would call it a very clean Polish men's room.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.720]   It was blue, blue tile, very minimal.
[00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.760]   There was no furniture in the wall.
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.360]   A GE portable air conditioner wedged into the wall.
[00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.360]   That was the air conditioning.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.240]   There was one spectacular piece of furniture.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.040]   You could not ignore this.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.400]   It must have been salvaged from the bombing.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.320]   Fantastic.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.360]   It was like this banquo table, a conference table made of teak
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.400]   and cut into it, embossed, was hand carved in three dimension.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.760]   Elephants, pictures of elephants tearing down teak trees with their trunks.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.040]   in order to build this table, you see.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.360]   So it was a reflective table.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.040]   It told a story about itself.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.560]   And in fact, it was doubly, it was reflexive.
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.400]   I mean, occasionally I could see myself,
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.760]   because there's a piece of glass over it,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.440]   reflected in this piece of glass.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.160]   And I was wearing this Thai peasant's outfit,
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.200]   blue cotton from Thai cottage industry.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.640]   So I really, I looked the part.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.880]   I mean, they were already saying you would go over well in Hanoi.
[00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.560]   They would like you very much with that outfit on.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.000]   Now, the Vietnamese were very sharp and very curious
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.440]   and listened very well to this particular foreign minister very well.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.520]   I mean, the American embassy, they pontificated.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.720]   They didn't listen to us, so why should they?
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.480]   What do they care about two Americans and Bangkok?
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.280]   Anyway, but the Vietnamese really wanted to know
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.120]   why two Americans wanted to go to Hanoi.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.760]   And this man was sharp and he was listening.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.520]   And may I say, please, before we start this conference,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.560]   may I ask one question, please?
[00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.560]   I hear America now says Vietnam is on back burner.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.080]   What means this back burner?
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.240]   Can you translate for me?
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.760]   Does it mean we're burning up?
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.840]   And Tom says, "No, no."
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.200]   Tom's very politic, very good at this sort of thing.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.600]   He said, "No, look at it this way.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.680]   "Say you have some rice.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.440]   "And you have some coffee, hmm?
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.080]   "All right, Central America will be the coffee.
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.200]   "You guys will be the rice.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.040]   "We've got the rice.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.720]   "We bring the coffee forward to heat it up
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.400]   "on the front burner and we've got the rice.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   "Ah, I see, thank you very much."
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.080]   Now, Tom says, "I would like you to meet Americans.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.960]   "Number one, autobiographic storyteller Spalding Gray.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.160]   "Very pleased to meet you.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.400]   "Have you been on TV?"
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.680]   Now, I didn't know how to play this.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:38.520]   I wanted to be politic.
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.920]   I didn't want to just begin to say,
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.040]   well, I don't even own one.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.480]   It's not the way to start out.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.400]   You've got to feel them out
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.880]   and feel how they feel about television.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.200]   And I assumed the Vietnamese would like
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.280]   a major American public to know
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.040]   what it is they want to tell them
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.120]   and their revisionist thoughts and this kind of thing.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.480]   And also, NBC is going to Hanoi in May,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.960]   so I think the writing's on the wall.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:57.200]   So I didn't know which way to go,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.280]   but I didn't want to lie either,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.640]   so I kind of hinted at it and I said,
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.280]   well, actually, the truth is this,
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:03.200]   that I am close to being on, I'm about to be on,
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.120]   because David Letterman's rep, Jerry Mulligan,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.200]   son of an Irish cop from Cranston, Rhode Island,
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.400]   calls me about once every three months and says,
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.880]   David wants to know how that funny guy
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.520]   is doing down behind the table downtown,
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.400]   and can you say something funny
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.680]   to me over the phone, Spalding?
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:17.760]   I said, what?
[00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:19.680]   David wants to know if you can say something funny
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.200]   over the phone to me right now so I can tell it to him.
[00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.000]   Can you say something funny over the phone to me?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.800]   So I'm working on it.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.520]   I have it on the back burner.
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.960]   So now we were convinced that we would go.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.560]   You see, if we had to write a letter to Hanoi
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.640]   and find out if we would be accepted,
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.400]   we had to say why we wanted to go to that country
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.640]   and then wait a few weeks or four weeks,
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   I don't know what it was going to take,
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.360]   but meanwhile, Tom was able to go to Rene
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.720]   and completely calm her down by simply telling her
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.560]   that we would be back.
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:47.720]   I don't know if he was lying or not,
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.880]   but he was able to convince her with that tone he had,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:51.680]   Spalding will be back by July 8th,
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.520]   or we're going to Hanoi,
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.160]   but he'll be coming back with me, it's all right.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.600]   So she left feeling comfortable.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.840]   He kind of carried it for me.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.280]   Now I realized I was riding on Tom Bird's magic will carpet.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.240]   I would go when he went and where he went.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.040]   I would stay with him after all.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.840]   I thought, you know, here I am in Thailand.
[00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.880]   Why not stay here?
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:11.080]   You know, why go to China?
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.960]   Hang out with him until he's finished and then we'll go.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:15.240]   And chances of having a perfect moment in Thailand
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.080]   are excellent.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:18.480]   And I had heard that they were relocating down to Phuket,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.960]   this beautiful island in the Indian Ocean
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.360]   off the coast of Southern Thailand,
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:23.520]   and that they had fabulous magic mushrooms down there.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.000]   They made omelets with them and I thought,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.040]   well, if I don't have an organic perfect moment,
[00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.360]   I'll just induce one.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.600]   So I asked permission if I could ride,
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.280]   could I please ride on whatever,
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.200]   the bus that was being sent down there with the crew
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.600]   because I no longer had a driver.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.440]   I was through.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   I just finished my last scenes that took 66 takes.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.320]   So I was through with the film.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:50.600]   And so they said, yes, you can ride on the artist's bus.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.560]   Well, this is great.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:52.400]   I didn't, you know,
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.480]   I couldn't imagine who I was going to be on with.
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.840]   Had to get up at dawn because that bus was leaving.
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.720]   That was a 15 hour trip to Phuket
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.040]   down to one single dirt road.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.160]   That was the main road down to that island.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.000]   And then we were told
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.840]   that we probably wouldn't be held up by robbers,
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.560]   but possibly the Thai police would come on
[00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:07.600]   and wanted to see our watches
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.040]   and take them or something like that.
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:10.640]   So we're prepared to get up early.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:11.480]   I get on the bus.
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.640]   It doesn't look like an artist's bus to me.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.000]   It's an old fifties greyhound,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.320]   like an old greyhound rounded kind of thing.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.080]   And it's got air conditioning way up in the front
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.160]   and way off in the back.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.000]   So they're fighting over that.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.880]   And it was on the crew,
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.040]   people I have never spoken with or met before.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.400]   In the front seat is sitting Umberto Pasolini
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.760]   of the Pasolini banking and film family.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:31.880]   He has dropped out of banking,
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.640]   dropped out of the whole thing at 28 years old
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.520]   to carry orangeade for the film,
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.520]   to work his way up and to become a producer,
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.240]   to learn how to become a producer.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.280]   Next to him are sitting the Cambodian refugees
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.440]   from Long Beach.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.840]   They were brought onto the film
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.440]   because Palpat killed all of the Cambodian actors,
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.280]   so they had to get Cambodian social workers
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.920]   from Long Beach to play these small roles
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.520]   and also give authentic advice
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.680]   to how the film should really look
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.480]   because they were in Phnom Penh and a lot of them
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.320]   when the Khmer Rouge came in.
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.280]   Now, and also in front of me, Nivi Pal
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.800]   from Whittier College, she was related to Sihanouk
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.280]   and she was organizing the Cambodians
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.560]   because she said that it was a neo-colonialist adventure
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.280]   as far as she was concerned in this film.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.160]   They were treating the Cambodians like refugees.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.720]   Oh, the American actors were treated fine,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:15.640]   the Brits were treated fine,
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.160]   but they looked right through the Cambodians.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:18.760]   So she was steaming about that
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.640]   and bending my ear about organizing the Cambodians.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:23.320]   And next to me was a British spark,
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.360]   one of the electricians,
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.720]   and he was saying, Spalding,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.000]   what are you doing on this bus, man?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.120]   Where's your driver?
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.400]   And I said, well, to tell you the truth,
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.160]   I'm not really with the film anymore.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.440]   I'm just kind of, oh, on for a freebie, are you?
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.880]   Well, that's good if you can get it.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:41.040]   About six hours into the trip, we stopped for lunch.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.480]   And I ordered some fish and we're eating.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.520]   If monsoon comes up and I'm eating outside,
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.800]   it completely swamps my fish.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.400]   That's how fast those monsoons come up.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.800]   It's this fish swamp.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.640]   And I went in and I ordered some more fish
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.000]   and I came out in the parking lot
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.040]   and there was Ivan Straussberg.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.720]   Ivan, head of the second camera unit.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.160]   Ivan from South Africa, bit of a devil in my ear.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.720]   Ivan Straussberg.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.240]   So he goes, hey, Spalding,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.200]   are you on the same bus as I am?
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.440]   I said, yes, Ivan.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.880]   Yeah, you're in the back there.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.800]   What are you doing on the artist bus?
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.240]   He says, well, I don't know what bus it is
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.840]   or what's going on, but I'm not going to be damned
[00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.120]   if I'm going to ride the next seven hours
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.480]   without being stoned.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.520]   Will you join me in?
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:16.720]   Well, I thought, I'll give it a try.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.520]   I haven't been arguing with Rene or drinking.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:19.840]   Maybe this will be all right.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.120]   And God knows I don't want to spend
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:24.280]   the next seven hours in time.
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:28.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.520]   We just did it.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.360]   It's strong.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:31.800]   I just took three mild tokes.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.400]   Just a little mild paranoia came over me
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.040]   in regards to the artist's bus,
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.560]   because I thought, you know, about this artist's bus,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.360]   is it possible we could have missed the artist's bus, Ivan?
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.400]   Did there really is another fantastic bus
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.000]   somewhere on a better highway headed for Phuket
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   with Philip Glass, Laurie Anderson, David Byrne,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:59.400]   John Laurie, Eric Bogosian, Bill Irwin, Whoopi Goldberg,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.840]   all in a perfectly air conditioned bus on wonderful beds,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.080]   talking important talk and worst of all,
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.040]   smoking hookahs and laughing.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:10.800]   But I knew that was just a silly paranoid fantasy.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.760]   Get that out your head, get it out the way.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.040]   Be here now.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.880]   So I got on the bus and I was determined
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.700]   to make the best of it.
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:17.540]   This was my life.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:18.640]   It was happening now.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.440]   I wrapped up, by now I was freezing.
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   I could have been in Vermont.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.280]   It was a timeless moment, but it seemed like Vermont.
[00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.120]   I put on this coat, wrapped the towel.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.480]   The scarf around, I happened to be carrying a raincoat
[00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:28.960]   with me and got out a little Irish whiskey.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:29.880]   It was nipping at that.
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:30.720]   I'm looking out the window.
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.320]   It's 110 degrees, black monsoon.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.960]   It looks like a meaningless Wallace Stevens poem,
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   beyond human feeling, beyond human meaning,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.840]   a foreign song, a foreign sound.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.680]   I'm looking out.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   I don't know what's going on or where we are.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.140]   It doesn't look like anything I can relate to at all.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:46.040]   It's not, it has no memory at all.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.880]   And meanwhile, Ivan is giving me his stereo Walkman
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.600]   because he happens to have Beethoven string quartets.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.560]   So I'm catching up with Beethoven string quartets
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.400]   in Thailand.
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.240]   I've never heard them before.
[00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.240]   And it's a lovely kind of timeless situation.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.500]   And I'm perfectly content when all of a sudden,
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.680]   we round this corner and it was completely unexpected.
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.720]   When it's most unexpected, it's fantastic.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:05.620]   Through this ratty, meaningless palm trees
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.560]   is this incredible vista of the Indian ocean.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:11.040]   I was unprepared for the enormity of the waves
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:11.880]   of that ocean.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.960]   They were bashing in like an Oriental Hudson River
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:15.000]   school painting.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.360]   The black, black sky with white surf rolling under it,
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:20.660]   white birds blowing sideways in the monsoon wind,
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:25.660]   ratty palm trees blowing rainbows, arching, fantastic.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.020]   It was about a number nine.
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.140]   (audience laughs)
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.760]   On a scale of one to 10 of perfect moments,
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.220]   had I been out in my ocean briefs,
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.020]   I would have had to go home that afternoon.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.980]   And we arrive at last after a 12 or 15 hour trip
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.100]   in the town of Phuket.
[00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:42.380]   And we stay at the radius hotel we have stayed in thus far,
[00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.100]   the Phuket Merlin.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.140]   (audience laughs)
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:47.780]   It's not even by the ocean.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:48.840]   There's no ocean view at all.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.640]   The ocean is 20 minutes away.
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:52.140]   So I arrive at the hotel.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:55.240]   I come in and I'm going to stay with Tom Bird
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.980]   because I'm trying to save all my per diem.
[00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:57.820]   Now I'm not working.
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.640]   I'm really holding on to it
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:02.320]   because I've got $600 worth of Thai baht
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.880]   and I figure if I don't have a perfect moment,
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:05.060]   I will buy one.
[00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:07.940]   So just as we're going into the hotel,
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.160]   out comes this Thai worker,
[00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:10.660]   one of the grips on the film,
[00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:13.080]   and goes, "I've got them.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.560]   "I've got them."
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:15.780]   And I look into this bucket
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.680]   and they're glowing back a kind of phosphorescent blue
[00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.320]   coming off this heap of fungus.
[00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:24.060]   "I've got all the magic mushrooms,
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:25.880]   "as many as anyone would need.
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:27.420]   "I've got them."
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.920]   And I thought, "There's no way I will take any substance
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.700]   "from a man that smiles that much."
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:32.540]   (audience laughs)
[00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.720]   I will end up never coming back.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.540]   I'll end up staying here as a school teacher in Thailand.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.040]   So the next day was a day off.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:41.300]   If you have a travel day in the film,
[00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.700]   you always have a day off afterwards.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:44.780]   And some people on the film said
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:46.540]   that they had heard there was Shangri-La.
[00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.100]   One of the beaches was the most beautiful beach
[00:14:48.100 --> 00:14:49.140]   in the world, Caron Beach.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.380]   Well, I'd heard this Shangri-La rap before
[00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.500]   and had gone after those places occasionally.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.740]   But I thought it was just a tourist rap and hype.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:59.100]   But we rented one of those little trucks
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.140]   and went down with some people.
[00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.780]   And we're on a wonderful trip 20 minutes down
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.860]   through rice patties and water buffalo and little shacks.
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.500]   And we came out on this exquisite beach.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.500]   I'll have to say it was fantastic.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.400]   I'd never seen a beach before like it.
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.840]   There was no flotsam.
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.280]   There was no jetsam.
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.620]   There were no plastic bags.
[00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:18.460]   There were no cans.
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.660]   There were no, there was no seaweed even.
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.700]   There were no shells that I can remember.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:25.780]   It was just this fantastic beach, clear Indian Ocean,
[00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.700]   huge waves coming in.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.060]   The far end of the beach, as you looked up,
[00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.860]   were water buffalo that looked like they were posing,
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.700]   actually.
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:31.680]   They looked like statues in the mist.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.820]   They looked like kind of the Thai entry
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:35.980]   to the Robert Wilson Olympic Festival.
[00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:37.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.340]   And to the right of that were these little shacks,
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.020]   you know, where you could go just a little shed
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.340]   to go and get some fresh fish,
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.420]   right just caught in pineapple and beer
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.900]   if you wanted to have a little lunch over there.
[00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.420]   But Ivan and I didn't want anything to eat.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.060]   We charged right in like the two kids.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.340]   I couldn't believe that water and the temperature.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:52.660]   It was almost body temperature,
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.620]   so it was extremely pleasurable.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.820]   And it was a Kodachrome day,
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.980]   one of those days where the sun hadn't quite broken out
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:00.500]   and it was very bright but not real sunny.
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.700]   Now, the others with us went over to have brunch.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.580]   And Ivan and I were charging in
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.020]   and I didn't know what to do with my money.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:06.840]   And I said, "Wait a minute.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.800]   "I've got my $600 worth of Thai baht here
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.740]   "in my ocean briefs."
[00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.520]   And Ivan says, "Oh, just leave it on the beach, man,
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.740]   "with my cameras."
[00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:14.300]   And I put it on the beach, right, with the cameras.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.020]   And I started and he said, "You know in Africa,
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:17.100]   "when you leave your cameras on the beach,
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.860]   "the natives run right out of the jungle and steal them.
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.660]   "I mean, what are you going to do, hmm?"
[00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:22.480]   So I was kind of back and forth with this.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:24.700]   And see, he was kind of like a sadist
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:25.860]   playing into my masochism.
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:27.380]   He would titillate my titillator.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:28.460]   And he knew how to do it.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:29.300]   He knew how to do it.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:30.540]   Because we started into the water
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.020]   and he would say, "You know, Spalding,
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.420]   "on our next day off, we're going to go scuba diving.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:35.260]   "And I'll teach you."
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.940]   Oh, wow, I always wanted to do that.
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.200]   It's something I've been putting off.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.540]   I'm terrified mainly because of terror.
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.500]   And I needed a guide.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.700]   I needed a kind of scuba guru.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.220]   And I thought, this is going to be it.
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:48.620]   Ivan's going to be the man.
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.380]   He's going to be the man to initiate me,
[00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.060]   get me through my fears, you see.
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:52.940]   Because I'm very fearful.
[00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:54.220]   I'll call it phobic.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.060]   I'm very phobic of many things, particularly sharks.
[00:16:57.060 --> 00:16:58.900]   In fact, I really check out swimming pools
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:00.140]   even before I go in.
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:01.540]   I'm convinced someone to put one in
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.860]   is a practical joke, you see.
[00:17:03.860 --> 00:17:05.100]   So I'm starting into the water.
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:06.780]   And then Ivan, you say, "Oh, you'll have
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.000]   "rapture of the deep, man.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:08.940]   "You'll have rapture of the deep.
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.780]   "It's fantastic.
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:10.660]   "You'll see fish you've never seen.
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.260]   "But Spalding, look out.
[00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:15.300]   "There are these stonefish.
[00:17:15.300 --> 00:17:18.220]   "And if you step on them, you're dead in seven seconds.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.900]   "There's no remedy, so wear your sneakers."
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:23.740]   Now, let's see.
[00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.980]   Hey, he reminded me of Kenny Mason when we were kids.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.140]   I mean, he used to do the same thing
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:28.820]   when I was seven years old in Barrington, Rhode Island,
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:30.340]   sliding down a hill, snowy day.
[00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:32.300]   He'd say, "There's lions in those woods."
[00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.260]   And I believed him.
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.220]   Lions in winter in Barrington, Rhode Island.
[00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.100]   I ran all the way home crying.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.540]   So he was reminding me of that.
[00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.340]   And Ivan was titillating my titillator.
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:41.620]   And I was so excited by the story.
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.380]   And he was going, "Spalding, come out here, man,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:44.220]   "for the big waves.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:45.900]   "I see you like the little ones."
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.100]   But I was staying in the little ones.
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.100]   I was very nervous.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.140]   You know, so I was so excited.
[00:17:49.140 --> 00:17:50.500]   I couldn't believe we were there.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.420]   So I'd run down the beach
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:52.940]   to try to get a look at it, both of us.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:55.060]   And I'd run down, but I'd never be there.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:56.100]   And it was always Ivan.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:58.500]   And I'd run back, and I'd run back down the beach
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.780]   to try to get a perspective on it,
[00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:01.900]   and run back, and run down the beach, and run back.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.100]   And the third time back, Ivan was gone.
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:09.580]   And I thought, "Oh, shit, he's drowned.
[00:18:09.580 --> 00:18:11.160]   "God, these things do happen.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:12.380]   "I've read about them.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:15.020]   "This is unbelievable."
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.780]   And I then remembered that I had read a paper
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:17.960]   saying, "Don't swim in Phuket.
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.800]   "It's very dangerous.
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.340]   "Seven people have drowned in the past three years."
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:24.260]   And I said, "Oh, no, shit, oh, God."
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.420]   You know, the first thing that went through my head,
[00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.020]   and this was all going very fast.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.960]   The first thing that went through my head was,
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.980]   "Of course, making a film about this much death,
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:33.500]   "some real person has to go."
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:35.480]   Then the next thing that went through my head was,
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.080]   "It's not my fault."
[00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.740]   He was suicidal.
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:42.180]   And then the next thing that went through my head,
[00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.800]   and this was all going very fast,
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:47.780]   was, "Quickly find the most responsible man that you can."
[00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:50.760]   And there's no way I was going out on that high surf.
[00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.660]   And the man that came to mind was John Swain,
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.740]   the Paris correspondent for the London Times,
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.820]   who had covered the invasion of the Khmer Rouge
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.960]   and coming into Phnom Penh.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.580]   He was there.
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.460]   Many reporters were represented in the film.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:03.340]   Perhaps John Swain was the most narcissistic.
[00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:07.780]   He came to watch himself be played by Julian Sands.
[00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.380]   And so he was there, and he was at the brunch.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.220]   And I just yelled.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:15.220]   I just went, "John, John Swain, come quickly!
[00:19:15.220 --> 00:19:18.000]   "I can't see Ivan!"
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.420]   In the whole brunch, put down the chopsticks in slow motion
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:23.920]   and turn, and they charged.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.180]   Some came through the swamp, some came over the bridge.
[00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:27.960]   I was down by the dip of the lip of the sea,
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.940]   and I couldn't see out.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:31.060]   Judy Arthur, the publicist, had the good sense
[00:19:31.060 --> 00:19:33.240]   because I found out now that she had been a lifeguard once
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.200]   in a previous incarnation, and she was running on the top,
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.460]   up where the money and the cameras were,
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:38.880]   so she could get a better view.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:40.520]   And meanwhile, the others are gathering around me saying,
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:41.800]   "Don't worry," and my knees are shaking.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.640]   I'm about to throw up.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.980]   "Don't worry, he's all right, Spalding.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:44.820]   "He won't have drowned.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.440]   "He's from South Africa."
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:47.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.960]   I am trying to interpret this.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.440]   I'm pacing up and down on the beach.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.780]   Judy spots his head way out.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:53.980]   Indeed, he had drifted down from that slip tide,
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:54.820]   that rip tide.
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:56.560]   He wasn't drowning, but he had slipped way down.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:58.300]   And she calls him in, and he comes in.
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:02.020]   I say, "Ivan, my God, don't ever do anything like that again.
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.280]   "I really was convinced you'd drown."
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.440]   He says, "Oh, Spalding, look, I'm really sorry, man,
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.480]   "but I would never drown.
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.880]   "I'm from South Africa."
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:16.360]   Everyone goes back.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.200]   Everyone goes back for the brunch,
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.960]   and Ivan and I are lingering behind,
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.200]   and he says, "By the way, Spalding,
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.200]   "when you called, how many came?"
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:26.640]   I said, "They all came.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.760]   "Did Judy Arthur come?"
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:29.680]   Oh, yes, yes, Judy Arthur came.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.000]   Judy Freeman came.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.120]   All the Judys came.
[00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:34.200]   They all came.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.060]   Let's go get something to eat.
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:40.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:44.520]   And we went over to the brunch table,
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.240]   and I suddenly realized that I was surrounded
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:49.400]   by real people.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:52.820]   Up until now, I'd been hanging out with actors.
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:54.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.820]   And I always feel at ease with actors
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:58.120]   because they're no one, you see.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.440]   They're conduits.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.240]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.940]   But here I was with the real people
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.240]   that we were supposed to be playing,
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.800]   and there is nothing more threatening
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.960]   and challenging to an actor
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.680]   than to be around the person,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.160]   the real person he's supposed to be playing
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.120]   'cause you can never become that.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:15.760]   I was playing a person I met,
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.200]   and he works for the American Embassy in Bangkok.
[00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:19.720]   He's a Princeton graduate.
[00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:23.080]   He speaks six languages, including Khmer.
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.720]   I graduated from Emerson College,
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.680]   and I'm still wrestling with American.
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.280]   So these people are the real jet setters.
[00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:33.960]   They see the whole world as their stage.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.000]   They're fired correspondents.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   They're able to get on a plane.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.360]   They're in Beirut one day.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:38.680]   They get on feeling no loss.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:39.720]   They're like these little gods.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.160]   The next day, they're in a nuclear submarine
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:43.040]   off the coast of Southern France,
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.580]   and I'm quite taken by them.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.840]   John Swain.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.120]   John Swain, the Paris correspondent for the London Times,
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.960]   is having an argument about with someone
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.400]   whether or not there's any cocaine in the Khyber Pass.
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.160]   I know there is, and the other man is saying no, there isn't.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.380]   Judy Arthur, the publicist,
[00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:59.080]   is talking about her sixth trip to China.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:01.480]   Minty Clinch, the woman who's there to write her biographies,
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.360]   this great, fantastic Amazonian woman,
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.440]   is talking about hitchhiking through Patagonia alone.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.620]   I'm just trying to visualize Patagonia.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:13.000]   Chris Mengi's the cinematographer.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.560]   Chris is talking about his trilogy, opium trilogy,
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   tracing opium from Burma to its derivative,
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:22.480]   heroin in Harlem, and he's in there.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.340]   He's made three films.
[00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.200]   He's stuck in Burma.
[00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:25.640]   He's with the good guys.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:27.640]   The opium warlords control most of Burma,
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.520]   and he happens to be with the good opium warlords,
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.360]   and they got a price.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.320]   The bad ones got a price on his head,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.540]   and he's trying to get 18 months of rushes out on a donkey.
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:38.040]   Then Ivan Straussburg is saying,
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.780]   Spalding, you think Thailand's primitive?
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.300]   Hey, man, you should go down to the Amazon.
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.400]   Ooh, no Buddhist inhibitions there.
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.760]   I was down making a film about cocaine.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.080]   Just fly in there, get off the plane.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.960]   You'll have your mind blown, man.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.920]   Then there was Roland Nouveau,
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.280]   who had just flown in from Beirut
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.360]   to test out his underwater camera, Roland.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.800]   He had been in Phnom Penh,
[00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.760]   and he had shot pictures of the Khmer Rouge
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:01.640]   when they came in, and now he'd been in Beirut.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:02.640]   He got a new underwater camera.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:04.080]   He says, hi, mates, hi, blokes.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.920]   Gonna have a bit of a beer, shoot a few underwater pictures,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.640]   be off in Southern France in the morning.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:12.500]   Then there was this incredible woman who was fasting,
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.760]   who was on a 40-day fast.
[00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.600]   She was half Thai and half Scottish,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:19.560]   most beautiful, most unusual.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:20.820]   I mean, her mother was Scottish.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:21.800]   That's very unusual.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:23.360]   Her mother came over to marry a Thai man,
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.280]   and she was the opposite.
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.300]   They were doctors, and they had this child,
[00:23:26.300 --> 00:23:29.280]   and she grew up, and now she was fasting with us, you see?
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:31.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.480]   She was exquisite.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.080]   She had those almond Thai eyes,
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.860]   dark complexion, Thai complexion,
[00:23:36.860 --> 00:23:41.100]   but with the Anglican wasp bone structure and freckles.
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.640]   So she had first learned how to fast
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:44.760]   at a Texas fast farm in Texas.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.520]   Now she was doing a 40-day fast, watching us eat,
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.260]   and then there was me,
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.760]   who was looking at this incredible bee
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.260]   that looked like the cartoon of a bee
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:57.800]   because it was so fluffy, and the stripes were so wide.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:23:59.040]   I couldn't believe it was real,
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:24:01.880]   and I was going, "Wow."
[00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.380]   Look at that bee.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:13.900]   Never even saying, "It's just a bee, Spalding."
[00:24:13.900 --> 00:24:16.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.080]   Lunch was over, and Ivan and I
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:19.880]   wanted to charge back into that water.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.060]   We didn't even want to wait an hour.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.440]   We didn't wait an hour.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:24.320]   We went right down.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.360]   Ivan said, "Who here?"
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.680]   "Hey, hold, let's have a little Thai stick.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   "It's a good day for it."
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:29.720]   So he got out and rolled it.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.120]   I said, "I'll give it a try."
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.800]   After all, it usually unlocks my Kundalini in the worst way,
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:35.480]   and I can't let it out, but I figured that much beach,
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.720]   I could let it for a walk.
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.960]   I can go mad on that beach, and it wouldn't matter.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:39.880]   No one would arrest me.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.720]   I felt free at last, and I just a couple of tokes
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.000]   because it was very strong, and I don't like to really
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.460]   take too much of your last eight, nine, 10, 12 hours
[00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.600]   to tokes with me.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.840]   And so there's a mild paranoia that comes up with me
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.680]   about the money.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.640]   I'm very concerned about carrying around all this money.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:55.040]   I think I've really got to hide it somewhere
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.100]   where I can't think about it anymore,
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:58.440]   so I put it on the floorboards of the truck under the mat,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.440]   and I suddenly realized that maybe the ties
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.480]   that really need it will be able to read my mind
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:03.640]   'cause I've been so...
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:05.620]   So I said, "Why put it in a hiding place?
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:08.560]   "Just leave it out on the beach where it was before."
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:10.320]   And I left it right there, and I started into the water.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.680]   By now, Ivan was way out in the deep again,
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.400]   and I started going out, and I realized
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.920]   that I had less fear of going out into that water
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.120]   every time I thought about my money being stolen,
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.040]   and the anxiety would go, "Foop," over to the beach
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:22.080]   and land with the money.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.800]   And I found that I was free of the anxiety,
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.160]   and I was getting further and further out,
[00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:26.540]   and I wasn't thinking about sharks.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.200]   I was thinking about my money being stolen.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.600]   And further and further and further out,
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.320]   and further out, until all of a sudden,
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:32.920]   and I don't know how this really happened.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.560]   I don't, it was like a touch of amnesia in there.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.360]   I was so far out, I was beyond Ivan even.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.440]   I was further out than I'd ever been
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.500]   in any ocean in my life.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.360]   I could tell because of the view of the shore.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:48.360]   I'd never had a view like that before.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.920]   And there was no fear of being bitten
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.040]   because there was no body to bite.
[00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:53.480]   It was just Indian Ocean.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.280]   I had become the water, or the water, there was no I.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:58.600]   There was just this little pumpkin perceiver on the top,
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.440]   smiling ear to ear like a cork.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.660]   And up would go the perceiver,
[00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:04.640]   and the perceiver would bob up and smiling and go down,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:06.440]   and the waves would come up around the perceiver.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.400]   And the perceiver could have been
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.940]   in the middle of the Indian Ocean at that point,
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:10.160]   'cause there was a wall of water.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.080]   And the waves would go up,
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.640]   and the perceiver would go up again
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.000]   and look down this bank of water.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.080]   And far below, like an Hawaiian travel poster,
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.280]   way below was John Swain and Judy Arthur body surfing.
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:21.560]   And up again, and there was no time at all.
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.040]   It was perfect until a voice Ivan's called,
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.240]   "Sporty, man, come back, come back.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.660]   "I haven't tested those waters yet."
[00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:31.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.400]   And he brought me back into time and back into fear,
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:35.320]   and I believed him, and I lost my innocence.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.360]   And I went swimming in, and I was next to him,
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:40.080]   whoa, hey, you know, I was next to him, treading water.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.060]   And he says, "I'm going out, man,
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.120]   "and I'm going to test the waters that you are in."
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.320]   And he goes out and he comes back,
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.000]   and the water is pouring out through his nose.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.560]   He's like, (coughing)
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.440]   he's choking, he says, "My God, man,
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.420]   "I know what it's like to drown now.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:53.840]   "I almost drowned, I came that close to drowning.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.720]   "I know what the experience is now."
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.200]   And I thought, oh shit.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.520]   Now I'm going to have to go out
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.960]   and find out what it's like to almost drown.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.680]   I will be damned if I will be caught up
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:07.680]   in this male competitive ring.
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:08.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.840]   I know what Ivan's idea of a perfect moment is.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:12.920]   It's death.
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:15.640]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.400]   So I swam back in somewhat depressed,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.040]   'cause I knew now that I had to go home,
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.400]   the perfect moment was over,
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.640]   and I was a little spaced out,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.320]   and I ran into Penny Isles, the continuity lady on shore,
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.400]   just who I needed at that point.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.220]   Penny, Penny, I said, "You won't believe it."
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:31.960]   And I tried to tell her a little bit about the water
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.640]   and the perfect moment, but I said mainly,
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.240]   "Maybe this is something that can help you.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:38.680]   "I've discovered a new theory of displacement of anxiety.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.260]   "If ever you're afraid to do something,
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.280]   "fly, whatever, you need courage to do it,
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.600]   "just take a big pile of money and leave it somewhere
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.320]   "where it could be taken, and think on that money."
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.880]   She said, "Spalding, you know you're a strange bloke.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.900]   "I know that, don't you?
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.760]   "You think too much.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.820]   "And also, what are you doing testing your fears
[00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:58.040]   "at 42 years old?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.560]   "Didn't you do it as a lad?"
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:03.180 --> 00:28:06.280]   No, was I supposed to do it all then?
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:07.400]   I didn't do any of it.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.880]   As a matter of fact, no, my brother Rocky, Rockwell Jr.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.080]   was doing it all for me.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.560]   If he had any fears, he'd confront them.
[00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.960]   His biggest fear was the basement, the cellar of the house.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.040]   And when my parents went away,
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.020]   he would turn out all the lights and start in his bedroom
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.600]   and crawl on his belly, all the way down the front stairs,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.680]   down the basement stairs,
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.720]   and go around with his eyes closed like this
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.760]   in the basement and feeling every crack
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:27.520]   until he either died or didn't die.
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.880]   But now I was doing it, and Penny said,
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:31.120]   "Well, you're going to walk with me
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.960]   "all the entire length of the beach
[00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.280]   "and not look back once."
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.480]   So I walked the whole beach,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.920]   all the way down to the water buffalo with Penny, backwards.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.280]   (audience laughing)
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.640]   I got down to the far end,
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.640]   and there I fell into another kind of (vocalizing)
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:49.400]   I lost my will and began drifting
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.920]   in this new energy of water buffalo and Thai herds boys.
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:54.440]   And these water buffalo were up to my shoulders,
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.480]   and these ratty boys in ratty clothes with sticks,
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.360]   and they were talking in Thai,
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:58.240]   and they were herding the buffalo.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.160]   And I was in amongst them, proudly naked.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.480]   I mean, just by ocean briefs, I was barefoot,
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.080]   feeling very vulnerable, and I just began to drift.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.240]   I mean, I don't think they even saw me.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.480]   I felt like Casper, the friendly ghost.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.800]   I would have gone anywhere with them.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.880]   I was in their energy field, and I was content to be in it.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.440]   And they were sweeping me away up the beach
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.680]   until a human voice woke me and I drowned.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.640]   Judy Freeman called, "Spalding, Spalding,
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.880]   "time to go back to the Phuket, Maryland."
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:32.080]   I went.
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.360]   I had to.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:35.320]   These people were my umbilical cord.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.080]   I got back to the hotel,
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.400]   and I had to find an audience quickly
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:42.720]   to tell the perfect woman story to,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.240]   and my best audience at the hotel,
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.600]   I'd be rapidly becoming Athol Fugard.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.680]   Also from South Africa.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.520]   Now, Athol had just given up drinking,
[00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.840]   and I think he was somewhat living through me,
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.680]   vicariously.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.680]   Spalding, get dressed, we're going to have your beer.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.240]   I'll buy your beer, I'll have a bit of an orange,
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:01.480]   and smoke my pipe here, and he'd load up his pipe,
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.960]   and he'd tell me all about your day.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.200]   I said, "Well, the main thing that happened, Athol,
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:06.640]   "it was incredible, I told him all about the ocean,
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:07.480]   "the Indian Ocean."
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:11.400]   He said, "Spalding, she's a lovely lady
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:14.320]   "if you play in her, but if you play with her,
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.840]   "she's a bitch.
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:19.840]   "Don't ever play with the sea,
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.400]   "and you're lucky to be here.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:24.080]   "You're lucky, lucky to be alive."
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.760]   So Athol put the fear of God into me,
[00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.600]   and we went out and ate, and Tom Bird,
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.120]   Athol Fugard, Graham Kennedy, and I,
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:33.760]   we all had dinner, and afterwards Tom and I
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:35.600]   went window shopping for whores,
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:38.000]   and went to bed in his room, in my bed,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.640]   he and his, me dreaming of the sea,
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.980]   like a kid wrapped in the arms of the sea again,
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:45.960]   like Jerusalem, Rhode Island, sand in the bed,
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.200]   the whole bed rocking fantastic sleep.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:55.960]   The next day, June 24th, was back-to-work day.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.000]   After you have a travel day and a day off,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.680]   then you have a back-to-work day.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.800]   I didn't have a back-to-work day
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.140]   because I was through with the film,
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:04.720]   I had finished my last scenes,
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.240]   but I was very anxious and excited
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.880]   to see this particular scene,
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.880]   because it was the scene where Sidney Schonberg
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.280]   first saw the Khmer Rouge at a Pepsi-Cola factory
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.760]   outside Phnom Penh.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.720]   Now, they couldn't find a Pepsi factory in Phuket,
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:19.280]   but they did pretty close, they found a Coke factory,
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.980]   and as far as I know, I haven't tasted them lately,
[00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.040]   but they're pretty similar, and they're down there,
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.160]   and everything's burning, we arrive,
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.500]   and they're getting set up for the first big scenes.
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:30.400]   We get to throw Coke cases at the wall to smash the Cokes,
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.140]   the trucks are in fire, the buildings are on fire
[00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:33.920]   with that perpetual flame that is based
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.680]   like a gas heater along the edge of the building,
[00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:37.340]   so the building is burning.
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.760]   The Thai peasants are there,
[00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:40.440]   all of the peasants that are doing extra work,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.240]   they look like they've been totally burned,
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:43.640]   the third-degree burns, the art department
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.080]   has done an incredible makeup job,
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.440]   chicken giblets dripping off their faces, blood.
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.840]   They are really gross, and they're standing in line.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.080]   There's about 500 Coke cases are gonna be blown up
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:53.880]   in a warehouse, it's gonna be a big scene,
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.720]   the pyrotechnics are all excited,
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:59.200]   it's gonna be their first big bomb scene of the film.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.520]   And I want to talk to people very quickly.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:03.160]   I want, suddenly, because I'm feeling
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.800]   like I'm leaving forever, I will never see
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.800]   these people again, it's that terrific loss feeling
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.400]   that's coming over me, really kind of very desperate,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.280]   I want to talk to everyone about everything quickly.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.560]   And so I go to Keith, the costume, yeah,
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.680]   I never really talk with Keith,
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:18.560]   and I just fell into a conversation with him,
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.660]   and he was the only one that understood
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:22.840]   my theory of displacement, anxiety.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.300]   He said, oh, I know all about it.
[00:32:24.300 --> 00:32:26.200]   Oh yes, I have a white witch up in Nottingham.
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.100]   Oh, she's a bit of a white witch,
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.820]   then she's not plucking anything like that.
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.040]   But whenever I fly, you see, I'm afraid of flying.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.040]   She gets mildly ill, she takes on a bit of a fever,
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.840]   a bit of a sickness there, and I have a lovely flight, lovely.
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:38.760]   Also, I knew about this woman, she was acting on stage
[00:32:38.760 --> 00:32:40.840]   with this other bloke, she didn't like him.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.420]   She wanted to have him trip and break his leg,
[00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.860]   so she put a note under the carpet on the stage,
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:47.300]   said, may he trip and break your leg, and he did.
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:50.040]   Oh, I know all about it.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:53.800]   Then I went over to Heng and Gore.
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:55.520]   Heng was playing the role of Dith Prahn.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:58.000]   Now, I had avoided talking with him.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:58.960]   I had avoided talking with him
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.520]   because I was afraid to hear his story.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:02.240]   I thought I would be ashamed to hear his story.
[00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:05.080]   I figured people had asked him his story enough.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.840]   I wasn't his friend, we talked about other things,
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:10.660]   but I always avoided that story of his.
[00:33:10.660 --> 00:33:13.440]   You see, he was really playing his own autobiography.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:14.760]   He was playing the role of Dith Prahn,
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:16.980]   but they were both tortured under the Pol Pot regime
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:19.440]   for three, four years, and I had heard his story.
[00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.120]   I mean, he was a Cambodian gynecologist.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.160]   He now lives in Los Angeles, doesn't practice here
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:26.040]   because he hasn't got his papers, but in Cambodia, he did.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:27.860]   Here, he's a social worker, but I had heard
[00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:29.480]   that he was operating as someone on the table,
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:31.360]   and the Khmer Rouge came in and said, where's the doctor?
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.440]   And he just threw down everything
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:33.480]   as soon as he heard they were coming
[00:33:33.480 --> 00:33:35.360]   and said he was a taxi cab driver,
[00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:36.720]   and he left the patient on the table,
[00:33:36.720 --> 00:33:39.160]   and he was able to survive as a cab driver,
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.100]   and he kept lying and lying, and I said, so what happened?
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:44.540]   He said, and I know why they cast him in this film,
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:45.980]   by the way, I think because his anger
[00:33:45.980 --> 00:33:48.140]   was the most successful of any Cambodian that we've seen.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:49.100]   It was right on the surface.
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.320]   It was, sit up, there, sit up, sit down, like that,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   whereas the other Cambodians were always blissfully smiling.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:00.060]   I couldn't, I don't know why,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:02.140]   what they had to do with the Buddhism.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:03.920]   They'd seen too much to talk about,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.300]   but they were just very, very gentle,
[00:34:06.300 --> 00:34:08.500]   very anxious right there, and I went to him,
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.860]   and I said, what's that, what, what, what happened?
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.240]   They take, they, come here, take,
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.700]   they tie the plastic, plastic bag over my head.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.160]   They tie the plastic bag over your head,
[00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:23.160]   and they take me, they tie me to a cross.
[00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:26.460]   They tie you to a cross, yes, and burn my legs,
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.580]   and he showed me the legs, his burn on his legs,
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:30.780]   and I said, what were you thinking?
[00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:32.020]   I mean, how did you get through this?
[00:34:32.020 --> 00:34:33.420]   Was there anything going on in your head?
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.020]   Yeah, I know, if I tell the truth, I'm 100% dead.
[00:34:37.020 --> 00:34:40.780]   Now, only 98% dead, truth, 100% dead.
[00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.180]   I said, how did you escape?
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:43.940]   He said, the Khmer Rouge, they take,
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:46.660]   they put me in a jail and burn it down.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:48.940]   It was so crazy, they burned down their own jail,
[00:34:48.940 --> 00:34:50.660]   and he was one of the few that escaped
[00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.660]   and walked through Cambodia eating the traditional diet
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.300]   of bugs, lizards, bark, leaves,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.200]   and he made it to a Thai refugee camp,
[00:34:58.200 --> 00:35:00.260]   and now he's living in LA.
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:06.460]   Then I went to the British sparks, the electricians.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.140]   These guys are really envied.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:10.560]   They had the balls, or it was a class thing, probably,
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:13.540]   or the lack of consciousness, or they just did it.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.140]   As soon as they arrived in town,
[00:35:15.140 --> 00:35:16.620]   they went and bought women.
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:17.940]   They call them their Thai wives.
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:20.640]   Each guy bought two, so he wouldn't risk falling in love
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.420]   and would be able to leave without a great feeling of loss,
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.940]   and I know it's supposed to be wrong to buy women.
[00:35:25.940 --> 00:35:27.280]   I think all the actors felt that,
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.900]   but they'd do it around on the sly behind.
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.860]   These guys just travel with them laughing,
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.820]   and it was a lot of fun,
[00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:33.460]   and I used to listen to that hotel door,
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.240]   and I couldn't believe how jolly it was.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:36.420]   They'd come home from work at night,
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.500]   and they'd be in the shower with the Thai wives laughing.
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.600]   They weren't speaking much English.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.740]   The Thais, certainly the English weren't speaking,
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.840]   the British weren't speaking much Thai,
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:44.860]   but the only thing the Thai wives knew
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:47.660]   were words from the songs that were popular then
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.500]   that they would dance to.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.820]   Lies, lies, lies, liar, and do you want to funk?
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:51.980]   But they were in the shower saying,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.040]   "I kick your ass! (laughs)
[00:35:54.040 --> 00:35:56.180]   "I kick your ass!" in pidgin English.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.700]   And then what would happen, you see,
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.660]   in the day the Thai wives would sit around the swimming pool
[00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:03.500]   and talk with each other about whatever.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:04.500]   I don't know what.
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:06.040]   And then the men would go to work,
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.000]   and at night the men would come home,
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.900]   and they'd all go out for dinner,
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.740]   and the Thai wives would order,
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.700]   and they'd talk among themselves,
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.840]   and the men would talk amongst themselves about their,
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.940]   it wasn't a radical idea.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.260]   (audience laughs)
[00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:17.180]   I mean, it was rather traditional.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.540]   The only thing that was different,
[00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.000]   say, from the American nuclear family
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.320]   is the amount of laughter that was coming off the table.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:24.880]   It really seemed like they were happy.
[00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:27.160]   Now, I have been to prostitutes in Amsterdam.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.580]   I've been to prostitutes in New York City.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.920]   It's not a joyful thing.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:30.760]   It wasn't.
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.420]   That's why I haven't gone back in many years.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.620]   I mean, it's like going to a very cold doctor,
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:37.040]   you know, business as usual.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.540]   There's no fun in it at all.
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:41.020]   These Thai whores, they laugh all the time.
[00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:43.700]   If they're not having a good time, they're really acting it.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.660]   I mean, I could see how someone would fall in love.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.400]   No, all right, I've heard the other side of the story.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.240]   I'm not ignorant.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.380]   I was listening to KPFK three weeks ago.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.220]   (audience laughs)
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.540]   I was riding in the car,
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:36:58.540]   and I heard one very angry woman
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.100]   talking about her most recent investigatory visit to Thailand.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:06.180]   And that they do have kidnapping, slave trade,
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.340]   10-year-old girls that they bring to these whole houses
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.700]   and chain, keep them chained to beds, handcuffed.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:12.380]   And one of the whole houses burned down.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.780]   They found all these 10-year-old skeletons burned,
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:16.220]   you know, still chained to the bed.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.380]   So there is another side to it, I'm sure.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:19.700]   This is another side to everything.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.480]   It's dark and light, yin and yang.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.220]   I didn't see that dark side.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.840]   I saw a lot of laughter going on,
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.180]   and these women feeding these men,
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.740]   like goganchu and gogans.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:29.620]   It's coconut-flavored rice.
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:30.780]   I want it in.
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:33.160]   (audience laughs)
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:34.980]   Boom, all of a sudden, the fighting begins.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.820]   (growls)
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:37.220]   They're carrying a dead dog.
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.040]   Lon Nol's army falls down on it and pretends to be eating it.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:43.620]   Boom, 500 coke cases are blown across the warehouse.
[00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:44.460]   (growls)
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:45.740]   The Khmer Rouge come running in.
[00:37:45.740 --> 00:37:46.580]   (growls)
[00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.740]   John Swain is running off camera behind Julian Sands,
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:50.300]   who's playing him, and John's going,
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:51.660]   "My God, what a great war.
[00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:53.600]   "I've never been in such a fantastic war.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.300]   "You know you're not going to get killed."
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:57.500]   Which confirms my whole idea about war therapy.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:38:00.100]   Every country should do a major motion picture,
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:01.740]   a war film every year.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:03.460]   Work it out, get that anger out.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.900]   You know, make a lot of money, keep the country going.
[00:38:05.900 --> 00:38:07.600]   And all of a sudden, it's lunch.
[00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.900]   (audience laughs)
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:11.940]   And we go in, and there they are,
[00:38:11.940 --> 00:38:14.420]   and they're sitting next to me, all of these Thai extras,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.980]   and they've got blood coming off of them,
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:18.020]   and their burn marks, and their faces are peeling off,
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.720]   and they're sitting next to me, and we're eating,
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.380]   and a monsoon comes up and blows down one of the circus tents
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.060]   and knocks out a real Thai woman,
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:24.980]   and they bring her in and put her
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:26.500]   in the middle of the lunch table.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.820]   And then lunchtime is over, and the monsoon stops,
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:29.980]   and the monsoon's fighting the war,
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:32.900]   and, wow, black smoke is pouring off the tires,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:33.740]   the rubber tires.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.260]   I've got a white mask over my face,
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:36.960]   and Judy Freeman's on sound, and she says,
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.380]   "Spalding, what are you feeling guilty about?
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:40.780]   "What are you doing in the middle of the war
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.240]   "when you could be at Paradise Beach?
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:43.940]   "Chris and I have a house down there.
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:45.660]   "Go down there, you know, use it.
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:46.740]   "We're not using it.
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.580]   "Go back."
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:48.580]   I thought, "She's right.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:50.180]   "What am I feeling guilty about?"
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.420]   (audience laughs)
[00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.200]   That's a question I'm not gonna go into here.
[00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.980]   I thought, "I'll just go down to the beach."
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.740]   And I walked out, it was fantastic.
[00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.980]   I felt like I was walking out of seventh grade
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.580]   at 10 o'clock in the morning.
[00:39:01.580 --> 00:39:03.540]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:05.520]   It was such a liberating feeling.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.560]   And I, it was great.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.840]   I went down, I got Billy Patterson
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:11.100]   and his girlfriend Hildegard,
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.180]   and, ah, we went and got some Cambodian refugees,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.500]   and we rented a car again and went down to Caron Beach.
[00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.820]   Carefree, fantastic.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.020]   I'm walking around on the Cambodian.
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:19.820]   Oh, it's beautiful, not as nice as the first time.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:22.220]   It never is, but it was still exquisite.
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.260]   And I was walking with one of the Cambodian refugees,
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:25.340]   and I said, "What have you been doing
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:26.260]   "for fun and activity?
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:27.660]   "I mean, you've hardly worked at all in the film.
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:29.660]   "What have you been doing with your time here?"
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.380]   And he said, "Fighting, I love it.
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.340]   "Last night, I fought six times."
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.500]   I said, "What do you mean fighting?"
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.160]   It turns out they had all these euphemisms.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:37.000]   I don't know why.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.300]   Fighting meant fucking.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:39.780]   And if they were going for a massage,
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:40.980]   they called it an interview.
[00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:42.300]   Now, I know where that came from.
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:43.900]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:45.780]   That came from one of the Cambodian refugees
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.100]   who was there with his wife,
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:48.540]   and every time he wanted to go for a massage,
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:49.380]   he said, "Where are you going?"
[00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:50.440]   He said, "I'm going for an interview
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.260]   "about my role in the film."
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.780]   See, so he had a very small role, too,
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:55.580]   and he was going out for these interviews constantly.
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:39:57.460]   He had an interview with massage.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.100]   Fighting was fucking.
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.740]   So I said, "You've fought six times?"
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.360]   Well, that's quite something,
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:06.260]   but aren't you afraid of that new strain of gonorrhea
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.260]   in the Southeast Asia that's knocking down doors?
[00:40:08.260 --> 00:40:09.600]   It's incurable?
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.440]   No, not at all.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.580]   He said, "Hang Nagor is a Cambodian gynecologist,
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:14.900]   "and he told me after you fight,
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.880]   "drink lots of beer to wash it all out,
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:19.620]   "and in the morning, eat plenty of penicillin."
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:22.020]   So this guy was on a beer-penicillin diet
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:23.540]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.860]   and believed in it.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:26.020]   He completely trusted it,
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:27.260]   and therefore, it was working.
[00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:28.180]   I mean, through faith.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.860]   I couldn't have done it.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.100]   And so he walked down the beach,
[00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.980]   and he was picking coconuts, fresh coconuts,
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:33.860]   cutting off the top,
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.100]   and we were drinking coconut milk,
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.080]   and we came upon two tourists.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.220]   Now, you come upon two tourists on the beach,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:41.780]   you stop and talk.
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:45.340]   It was Jack and Mary from Saudi Arabia.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.060]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.140]   Jack from Washington, Mary via Dublin,
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.020]   but they were, Mary was a nurse in Saudi Arabia,
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:55.340]   Jack was a plastic surgeon, skin specialist,
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:56.900]   and they were traveling companions.
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:57.740]   They'd come on a vacation,
[00:40:57.740 --> 00:41:00.420]   although Jack was thinking of staying in Thailand
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.720]   because he'd heard about the Thai wives getting jealous
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.020]   and cutting off the penises and feeding them to the ducks,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.100]   and now the men had gotten wise
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:07.540]   and are now pulling them out of the ducks' throats
[00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:10.260]   and getting them sewed on special penis transplant wings.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:13.620]   He told me that there is more interesting work
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:16.020]   in plastic surgery going on in Thailand
[00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:17.360]   (audience laughs)
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:21.100]   and in the Philippines than any other country in the world
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.940]   that he was thinking of staying on.
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:25.320]   So I said, "Great, come, eat with us, sup with us,
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:26.460]   "lunch with us."
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:27.780]   This was like a Hemingway novel.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.200]   I said, "Tell us of your travels of the world.
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:32.480]   "Come, tell us of Saudi Arabia."
[00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:33.740]   (audience laughs)
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.040]   And Mary says, "Oh my God, you wouldn't believe it.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.840]   "Oh, they're primitive lot there, they're savages.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:39.840]   "I'm so glad to be out of their country then.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.300]   "Oh, they still have a public execution,
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:43.460]   "it's beheadings then.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:44.300]   "And if you're a foreigner,
[00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:45.740]   "they push you right in the front row,
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.660]   "and when you see their head come off, plop, you think.
[00:41:48.660 --> 00:41:49.940]   "Oh, you think that away.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.540]   "It's a terrifying thing.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.380]   "They also be cutting off hands now, still, for thievery.
[00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:55.700]   "And they cut it off their hand,
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.840]   "and they put it in the boiling oil,
[00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:59.400]   "they put the stump there to cauterize it.
[00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:01.080]   "And they have the stone in.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:01.920]   "It's a modern method.
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:03.620]   "I was there when the adulterous was stoned.
[00:42:03.620 --> 00:42:05.760]   "She got pregnant, they let her have the baby,
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.340]   "and afterwards, they buried her up to her neck in sand,
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.820]   "and they back up a big dump truck filled with stones,
[00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:14.880]   "and they go, oop, plop, that's good God.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.060]   (audience laughs)
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:19.220]   "Thank God we're still living in America, most of us."
[00:42:20.180 --> 00:42:21.860]   And, you know, the conversation ran its course,
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:24.420]   as it often does at tables, sex, debt, taxes,
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.100]   and usually spirals down and ends with shit and money.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:28.620]   If it's mixed company, it ends with money.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.700]   It happened to be mixed company.
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.500]   It happened to end with money.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:33.300]   Now, I usually talk about money openly.
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.340]   People ask me what I make.
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:35.620]   I realize it's kind of a mistake.
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:37.360]   I've been changing my mind since I've been out here.
[00:42:37.360 --> 00:42:38.220]   People have warned me.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:39.820]   I don't know what it has to do with being out here,
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.900]   but they say, "You should be more cautious."
[00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:44.900]   Now, my father never talked about money.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:45.760]   It was a taboo subject.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.280]   I think it is with most people.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:49.040]   But Billy Patterson turned to me and said,
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:50.800]   "So, Spalding, hey, what are you going to do, man,
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.720]   "with all the money you make on this film?"
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.880]   I said, "What money, Billy?"
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:54.980]   I thought it was a low budget film,
[00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.620]   you know, medium budget, 20 million.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:42:59.020]   I was told that all the actors were getting the same
[00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:00.060]   except Sam Waterston.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:01.620]   The star was getting a little bit more.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.500]   But when I came into the film, that was the agreement.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.140]   That's why I didn't negotiate.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:06.600]   "Well, I don't know, what are you making?"
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.960]   I said, "Well, if you tell me, I'll tell you."
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.020]   So he said, "As far as I know,
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:16.220]   "all the Brits are making 3,000 a week and 325 per diem."
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:17.060]   I said, "Really?
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:19.780]   "Well, I was feeling pretty good about mine.
[00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.040]   "So you're telling me that I'm making 1,500 a week
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.140]   "plus 325 a week per diem.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.840]   "And 3,000 is twice as much, isn't it?"
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:30.720]   Billy turns to me and says,
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.320]   "Well, maybe that's because you don't have an agent."
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:38.920]   Bah!
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:42.180]   All of a sudden I see white, of course, an agent.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:44.060]   What am I doing hanging out like an old hippie
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:46.660]   on the beaches of Thailand looking for perfect moments?
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.020]   What am I doing looking, at 42 years old,
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.740]   for cosmic consciousness?
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.320]   Cosmic consciousness belongs to the independently wealthy
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:54.520]   in this day and age.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.360]   Go, don't go to Hanoi.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:57.940]   Go, get an agent, go to Hollywood.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:59.600]   Make five movies you're not interested.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.100]   Buy your own home out in the Hamptons.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.180]   Have your own perfect moments in your own backyard.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.160]   Have your friends come over
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.780]   to have perfect moments out there.
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.620]   What are you doing?
[00:44:06.620 --> 00:44:07.980]   What was the film about?
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.580]   Survival, of course, your survival.
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:13.260]   Go, do not go to Hanoi.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.320]   Do not pass, go.
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:16.040]   Go, get an agent.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:19.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:21.400]   Exhausted by this epiphany,
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.820]   I staggered down onto the beach
[00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:26.140]   and fell into a semi-enesminism sleep
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.500]   where I dreamed that I was back in my own territory,
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.540]   back in the Atlantic Ocean
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.540]   without having to fly that ridiculous 24-hour flight.
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.740]   And the Indian Ocean now sounded like the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.620]   I was in that kind of semi-limbo sleep
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.820]   when I was woken by boat people, boat people,
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:40.180]   boat people, boat people.
[00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.740]   And I looked up and there was the Thai waiter
[00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:43.420]   from the restaurant looking out with binoculars
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:44.660]   about a mile and a half out.
[00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:45.900]   I took them and looked through them.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.260]   It looked like this old cider tub way out
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:49.580]   with these little heads lined up.
[00:44:49.580 --> 00:44:51.180]   Vietnamese boat people, I couldn't believe it.
[00:44:51.180 --> 00:44:52.920]   Was it really, really, really them?
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:55.300]   Were they coming to call on me now like some sort of vision?
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:57.300]   They looked like winking, blinking and nod.
[00:44:57.300 --> 00:44:58.500]   And I said, "Oh, no."
[00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:01.060]   And it was a Thai, the Thai fishermen, one Thai boat there,
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:03.420]   they're last suing the bow and trying to pull it in.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:07.160]   And Jack, Jack from Saudi Arabia via Washington State.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.700]   Jack, one of those guys that's so in touch with his body,
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.860]   he's out of touch with it.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.060]   One of those guys with incredible swimmer's body.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:15.460]   One of those guys who would hike up Mount Everest
[00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:18.080]   is to ski down it and videotape himself doing it.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:21.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.760]   For the weekend.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:26.340]   He comes over and pulls down his goggles
[00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:29.220]   and proceeds to go like a buzzsaw cartoon.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.060]   Ow, right through my perfect moment.
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.340]   Right through Ivan's charted waters.
[00:45:34.340 --> 00:45:36.460]   Disappears into the Indian Ocean.
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.660]   I'm pacing up and down about 20 minutes go by
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:41.140]   and he comes out, just walks out of the water.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.220]   And I said, "What the fuck?
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:45.840]   "What were you doing?"
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.420]   He said, "I just thought I'd swim out
[00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.040]   "and see if they were real boat people."
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.840]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:57.360]   But they got towed away before I got close enough to see.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.300]   Well, Jack, how far out would you say that was?
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:01.780]   Oh, a mile, a mile and a half.
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:04.520]   Well, do you do this sort of thing often?
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.580]   Oh, I do, I like long distance swimming.
[00:46:08.580 --> 00:46:10.420]   I was swimming once about two and a half hours
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.380]   off the coast of Jersey.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:14.180]   I said, two and a half hours?
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.140]   I mean, what if a thunderstorm came up?
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:22.560]   And I ran into this Leviathan type thing.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:25.380]   I should not been, it should not have let me hit it.
[00:46:25.380 --> 00:46:29.980]   It was big and I panicked and I started swimming.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.560]   And if you can imagine the quality of a swim,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.620]   if you're panicked, two and a half hours out.
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.800]   And he said the next day, some guy lost his leg
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.740]   up to his knee in knee deep water at that beach.
[00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:39.660]   A shark chomped it right off.
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:42.620]   So maybe I ran into that shark and just was lucky
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:44.740]   and hit it in the nose.
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:47.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:49.540]   So Jack and Mary, they wanted to come back with us
[00:46:49.540 --> 00:46:51.140]   and eat with us because they said Shangri-La
[00:46:51.140 --> 00:46:54.120]   and Caron Beach was a bore, was a bore at night.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:54.960]   And could they come back?
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.880]   Oh sure, please join us, sup with us, dine with us
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.300]   because we are 130.
[00:46:58.300 --> 00:47:00.860]   So you can imagine the different configurations every night.
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:02.920]   Sometimes you're with interesting people that you like.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.940]   Other times you just go along with the flow.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:06.500]   And so I said, yeah, come.
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.740]   I got back to the hotel and it turned out
[00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:10.500]   that Tom had finished his last shot.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:11.780]   Oh, total panic set in.
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.900]   This meant I had to go back, if I held,
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:16.180]   to this arbitrary structure that I had set up.
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.700]   You know, not to be broken.
[00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.900]   And so I said, oh wait a minute.
[00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:20.380]   Tom, wait, wait, listen.
[00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:21.980]   This beach, I know how you love the ocean.
[00:47:21.980 --> 00:47:23.740]   This beach is so fantastic.
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:25.220]   And this magic mushroom's there.
[00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:26.420]   Oh, we can eat them.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.360]   We could take them together.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.860]   I want a partner to take them.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:31.500]   Listen, Tom, you've got to see it.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.160]   Just four days, the Vietnamese can wait.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.700]   No.
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.660]   No, I gotta get going, I've had it.
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:38.000]   And brush that sand off your leg
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:38.840]   before you come in the room.
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.660]   Were you spalding?
[00:47:40.700 --> 00:47:41.820]   Wait a minute, a hotel room?
[00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:43.420]   You wanted me to brush?
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.140]   No, I knew, right then, I'm looking back on it,
[00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.260]   something was wrong.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:50.380]   Someone really, I needed some confrontational work.
[00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:51.540]   Someone was feeling guilty about it.
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:54.940]   I was so bad at it, I really regret not doing that.
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:00.380]   So, that night was the last supper.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:01.720]   No one knew that Tom and I were leaving.
[00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.100]   And we went out and we happened to fall
[00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.940]   into a wonderful last supper configuration.
[00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.700]   About 20 people, including David Putnam,
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.180]   the producer of the film, who was at the head of the table.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.900]   We could have been at the end of the world.
[00:48:10.900 --> 00:48:12.220]   It was exquisitely beautiful.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.640]   We were the only ones at the restaurant,
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.100]   this was not the tourist season,
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:16.840]   out beyond islands and the Indian Ocean,
[00:48:16.840 --> 00:48:18.660]   but no lights on it, no people out there.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:20.880]   It was like just us and the Thai waiters
[00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:22.740]   and some Japanese lanterns blowing in the wind
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:23.780]   and the trade winds blowing.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:26.100]   Then it was cool enough, and a beautiful night.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:27.700]   And I was sitting there and David Putnam
[00:48:27.700 --> 00:48:29.780]   was sitting next to me with a picture of John Malkovich.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.340]   He would make me very jealous
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.660]   whenever he'd pay attention to John.
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:34.280]   He said, "So, John Malkovich says
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.420]   "he doesn't want to make any more films, eh?"
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.740]   Mm, mm, mm, I wonder about that.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:39.820]   "He says he wants to go back
[00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:41.920]   "to the Steppenwolf Company in Chicago.
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.860]   "I do wonder," and I was a little drunk going,
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:45.580]   "Yes, I do wonder, too.
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:47.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:50.940]   "I think the lady doth protest too much."
[00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:52.500]   John is sitting at the far end of the table
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:54.620]   just taking it like water off a duck's back, fantastic.
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.860]   "The lady doth protest too much."
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:58.740]   John is wonderful in that way.
[00:48:58.740 --> 00:48:59.780]   He doesn't appear to be needy.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.700]   People come to him and he has a mystery about himself.
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:03.620]   He doesn't talk too much about himself.
[00:49:03.620 --> 00:49:07.300]   Now, I was a bit threatened by everyone
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:09.580]   because I've been doing solo work since 1979.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.420]   Suddenly I'm out in the field
[00:49:10.420 --> 00:49:12.220]   with all these talented actors,
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.540]   and I knew John was a good storyteller.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:16.220]   Not only was he a good storyteller,
[00:49:16.220 --> 00:49:17.140]   but he had a good agent.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.540]   Not only did he have a good agent,
[00:49:18.540 --> 00:49:20.620]   but he had a good manager
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:22.300]   because I noticed, I realized,
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.100]   the day that the Killing Fields review
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:26.100]   came out in the New York Times,
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:28.080]   on another page, about six pages away from that,
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.220]   John was mentioned in that review,
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.340]   was a little block, and it had a little short story
[00:49:32.340 --> 00:49:35.940]   about a blackout in the QE2 and its way to London.
[00:49:35.940 --> 00:49:37.500]   And who did they interview about the fact
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:39.460]   that the lights and power went out in this boat
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.220]   by telephone satellite?
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:42.700]   John Malkovich.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:47.020]   How did John get on that boat?
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:47.900]   His manager.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.260]   How did the lights go out?
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:53.300]   Of course.
[00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:55.980]   This is how people become famous.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.260]   It's manipulated, it's set up.
[00:49:57.260 --> 00:49:59.580]   You see the name a number of times in a number of places,
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.220]   and there it goes, and it rings.
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.540]   Now, I'm not saying that John Malkovich,
[00:50:04.540 --> 00:50:06.460]   was my brother, or David Putnam, was my father,
[00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.380]   although there was kind of a loaded family situation
[00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:10.520]   going on there.
[00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:13.020]   I mean, David was sitting at the head of the table.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:15.700]   My father sat at the head of the table, too.
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.260]   He didn't talk as much as David Putnam.
[00:50:17.260 --> 00:50:19.060]   He only said two things, really.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.920]   One was, all things are relative.
[00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.260]   That was one thing you always say.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.860]   And whatever you do, marry a wealthy woman.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:27.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:27.140 --> 00:50:28.100]   So it was a good advice.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:30.480]   You had your physical, your metaphysical,
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:33.420]   and your physical there, going real well.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.860]   But my father was a good provider.
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:35.940]   He liked David Putnam.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.300]   He would always steak and peas and mashed potatoes
[00:50:38.300 --> 00:50:40.500]   every Sunday, and roast on Monday.
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:41.580]   Roast lamb, roast beef.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:44.300]   I loved the roast beef, because it was always blood rare.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:46.740]   And I would go up for thirds, whether I was hungry or not.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.780]   I would send that roast beef up for thirds,
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:51.220]   and now I know, to some extent,
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.600]   I was trying to eat my father's body.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:55.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:56.580]   I understand that.
[00:50:56.580 --> 00:50:59.260]   I know I was trying to get love that I couldn't get.
[00:50:59.260 --> 00:51:01.100]   So I'd send it up, and it would come back.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:03.900]   And Rocky Jr., Rockwell Jr. would be between the two of us,
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.100]   and he would just take a big, oh,
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:06.140]   of roast beef off that plate.
[00:51:06.140 --> 00:51:07.460]   And I'd go, "What was that about?
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:08.300]   "Why'd you do that?"
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:10.600]   And he'd go, "Toll."
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:14.000]   So Rocky was the autocrat at the table, really.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.220]   Now, Rocky had a paper route, so he had a lot of dimes.
[00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:17.340]   And he had a game called dime.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:18.700]   If you touched him, you got a dime.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:19.620]   So he'd go, "Dime."
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:21.400]   That meant the game was on, you'd have to run.
[00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:22.460]   Just as you're about to touch him,
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.420]   he would always go, "Deal's off."
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.500]   He also had some forbidden names.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.040]   If you said them, you got hit.
[00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:30.940]   They were just simple names.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:33.060]   They happened to be my friends' names,
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.700]   but there was nothing to them.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.900]   I mean, I look both ways now before saying them,
[00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:39.580]   but really, Lucille Bispano, pump.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:41.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:41.180 --> 00:51:42.860]   Heather Henry, kook, kook.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:44.340]   Steve C, chop.
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:47.380]   And then my younger brother was born, Channing.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:50.340]   And Chan was born, and I knew what it was to be jealous,
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.980]   'cause Rocky fell in love with Chan.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:51:54.820]   And one summer day, when Chan was four years old and naked,
[00:51:54.820 --> 00:51:57.340]   I took him and led him into the middle of Rumstick Road,
[00:51:57.340 --> 00:51:59.540]   put him on the white line, and told him to stay there.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:03.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:06.700]   So I am not saying that David Putnam was my father,
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:09.780]   or John Malkovich was my brother,
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:11.480]   but something was going on,
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.780]   and I knew John could tell stories and sit at a table
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.220]   not unlike this one,
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:19.620]   somewhere far, far away from here in Alaska or Chicago.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.220]   And I knew he could entertain people and be very good at it,
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:25.420]   but I wondered, could I play the role of Biff on Broadway?
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:26.620]   Were we interchangeable?
[00:52:26.620 --> 00:52:29.660]   I knew John was going to get a Oscar in five years' time.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:30.860]   That would upset me,
[00:52:30.860 --> 00:52:33.580]   but the clarity of the vision was some compensation.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:35.060]   But now it looks like one year.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:36.580]   He's not a needy man.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:38.060]   And I know he can tell good stories.
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:39.660]   All right, this was a buddy film.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:43.700]   I'd never been in a male bonding situation in my life.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:45.580]   Now I was getting it at 42 years old.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:48.260]   I never in a fraternity, I was never in any sports.
[00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:49.900]   But we got together, it was all males.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:52.300]   We got together in one room at six o'clock for cocktails,
[00:52:52.300 --> 00:52:54.500]   and everyone would bond for about an hour.
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:55.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.780]   And there we were.
[00:52:57.780 --> 00:52:58.820]   Now if any women came,
[00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.200]   I think there's only one other woman actress in the film.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.880]   If Nell Campbell showed up very perversely, she'd show up.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.060]   Just give 'em the silent treatment.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:06.180]   We were all clued into that.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:07.820]   You know, just don't talk to them.
[00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.060]   And so it was a buddy film.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:09.900]   And we were sitting around.
[00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:10.940]   We'd often tell jokes.
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:14.340]   So we'd have them call us to tell about our day's activities
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.060]   and we were sitting telling jokes.
[00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:18.900]   We were all asked to tell a dirty joke at lunch
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:22.040]   because one of the Cambodian refugees was collecting jokes,
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:24.140]   dirty jokes, to bring back to Long Beach.
[00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:25.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.300]   And my turn came.
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:28.140]   I didn't know any.
[00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:29.060]   I couldn't tell.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.060]   All right, all right, all right, all right.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:30.900]   Here's one.
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:32.100]   It's a generic Dick and Jane.
[00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.440]   Dick and Jane.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:34.280]   It's back in the '50s.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:35.740]   It's their first date, so they're very nervous.
[00:53:35.740 --> 00:53:38.720]   Jane's dog is their collie, named, let's call it Spot.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:42.040]   Spot's asleep on the floor.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:43.880]   And Dick is very nervous.
[00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.060]   They're both very nervous.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:47.580]   The 45s are dropping down on a little record player.
[00:53:47.580 --> 00:53:49.100]   And Dick has gone out.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:51.020]   He's got the five-day deodorant pads on.
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.660]   Arid five days stay dry.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:54.740]   Underneath the aqua velva, Listerine.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:56.940]   He's all groomed, and he has bathed.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:58.020]   Jane is sitting next to him.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.180]   She's washed in Lysol.
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:01.620]   She's just there, and they're just smooshing.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.820]   But Dick has gotten very nervous just before he's come over
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:05.260]   and freaked out and gone off his diet
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.200]   and ate a huge bowl of baked beans
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.500]   with chopped red cabbage on top, you see,
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:12.380]   and finished it off with a dessert of two green pears,
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.460]   some figs, and a couple of apples.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:18.340]   So he is letting go with those incredible burners,
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:20.060]   those silent but deadly ones.
[00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:20.900]   You don't hear them come out,
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.540]   but when in the room, you know what's going down.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:27.660]   And the way he's doing that is when he lifts his cheek
[00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.300]   to kiss Jane, he eases one out.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:31.580]   Ooh, burner, goes out, and then he goes to the dog.
[00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:34.620]   Spot, oh, Spot, oh my God, ooh, Jane.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.260]   Did you say this dog was a thoroughbred?
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:37.860]   Ooh, what are you feeling?
[00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.140]   Then he goes over and kisses her again
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.740]   and eases out with the second one and goes,
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:42.780]   oh, Spot, come on, one more like that,
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:43.700]   and we're gonna take you to the pound
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.540]   and have you gassed on your own gas.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:46.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:48.060]   The third one, he eases out.
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:50.380]   She jumps up and goes, come on, Spot,
[00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:53.100]   let's get out of here before he shits on us both.
[00:54:53.100 --> 00:54:55.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:54:57.300]   That's all I could come up with.
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:58.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.420]   Oh no, there was one other, this traveling salesman stopped
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:01.860]   and he said he wanted a room.
[00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:03.140]   The guy said, we haven't got any rooms.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.700]   Oh, we got one upstairs, but you couldn't have it
[00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:06.420]   because the screens are ripped, flies, you wouldn't sleep.
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:07.260]   What do you mean I could take it?
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.260]   No, you wouldn't sleep.
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:11.220]   There's bottle flies, green flies, deer flies, horse flies,
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.660]   black flies, every kind of fly, you wouldn't sleep.
[00:55:13.660 --> 00:55:15.340]   The guy said, I'll pay you for the room right here
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.160]   and Cash will take it.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.580]   He goes up, comes down, rested the next day.
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.220]   The manager goes, you look like you slept.
[00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:21.060]   No problem, I slept fine, just a little bunching.
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:21.900]   You what?
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:22.980]   I just bunched the flies.
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:23.800]   You did what with them?
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.640]   I bunched them.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:25.700]   What do you mean you bunched them?
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.660]   I took a shit in a corner and I went to bed.
[00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:30.940]   (audience laughing)
[00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:32.820]   Now it was John Malkovich's turn.
[00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:35.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:36.960]   And it came around to him.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:40.020]   Now the Cambodian, I have to tell you, was strange.
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.060]   He was laughing at every line.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:43.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:55:43.580 --> 00:55:46.540]   For some reason, there's no concept of punchline in Cambodia.
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:48.740]   I don't know if it has to do with the translation
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:51.940]   or the polymorphous perverseness of the Buddhism or what,
[00:55:51.940 --> 00:55:53.600]   but it's just, everything was funny.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.440]   Job fantastic.
[00:55:54.440 --> 00:55:56.300]   I mean, you say, so there was this farmer
[00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:58.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:55:58.460 --> 00:56:01.800]   and his daughter, they were eating hot butted corn.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:02.640]   That's another one.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.980]   I forget all about that.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:07.780]   So anyway, John gets up and he goes, there was an elephant.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:09.060]   Already he's off to a good start.
[00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:11.600]   And a mouse, and the mouse was in love with the elephant.
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.300]   And there was a monkey up in the tree,
[00:56:13.300 --> 00:56:14.880]   chattering and throwing down monkey,
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.200]   yelling monkey invectives and throwing down coconuts,
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.580]   just randomly.
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:20.900]   The mouse is a guy, the elephant's a girl, right?
[00:56:20.900 --> 00:56:23.700]   And the mouse is really hot for this elephant,
[00:56:23.700 --> 00:56:25.420]   really loves it, wants to mount it.
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.100]   And it's running, and it goes, boom,
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:31.020]   bounces off the back legs, boom, bounces off the thighs.
[00:56:31.020 --> 00:56:31.920]   It's getting up a little higher.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:36.060]   This time, a real long running time, pop.
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.320]   Just as it gets up and mounts the elephant,
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.380]   the monkey hits the elephant in the head with a coconut.
[00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.580]   The elephant goes down, dazed on its knees,
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.540]   and the mouse yells out, yeah, suffer, bitch.
[00:56:46.540 --> 00:56:49.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:56:49.540 --> 00:57:00.340]   So I said, all right, which one did you like?
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.680]   Malkovich, Malkovich joke, I like him, Malkovich.
[00:57:03.680 --> 00:57:05.100]   I said, well, tell it to his back,
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:07.180]   'cause we want to make sure you got the punchline.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:09.980]   So he says, there's an elephant,
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:12.100]   a mouse in love with the elephant,
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:15.700]   a monkey up in the tree, and the monkey yells down,
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.860]   hey, elephant, you make good love.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:21.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:28.540]   So I'm sitting next to David Putnam,
[00:57:28.540 --> 00:57:31.180]   and I'm wishing that he would love me so much
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:32.020]   that he would read my mind,
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.660]   know it was my last supper, and buy the meal,
[00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:36.100]   'cause he was trying to figure out a way to write it off.
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:38.460]   He bought Craig T. Nelson a huge dinner,
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.220]   a big party for Craig T. when he left,
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:42.060]   but Craig T. was a professional actor
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:44.140]   and knew when to leave, you see?
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:46.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:49.380]   You know, Craig knew he was the end of his last scene,
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:51.180]   and he went, and he went home, and he acted as though
[00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.060]   even if he wasn't doing another role, he had one.
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:55.180]   And I was like this weird, poor relative,
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:56.860]   this little drummer girl, no one really could
[00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.140]   define what was going on.
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:00.860]   And I'm sitting there, and I'm a little depressed,
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:02.180]   'cause I know I'm going to have to go,
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:04.380]   and it's time to go, really, and Mary,
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:05.940]   the nurse from Saudi Arabia is bugging me,
[00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.820]   she keeps calling me Baldwin, Baldwin, Baldwin, this, Baldwin.
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:09.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:10.500]   I keep correcting.
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.940]   Baldwin, Baldwin, you think the Saudis are stupid?
[00:58:13.940 --> 00:58:15.420]   Ah, the Pakistanis are much worse.
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:17.780]   I was at a Pakistani hospital, and I told the guy,
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:20.060]   I said, you've got to give a urine sample, then.
[00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:21.460]   And he handed him the little bottle,
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:22.860]   and he goes behind the white curtain.
[00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:24.860]   An emergency comes up, and I forget about him.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.900]   Two hours later, he comes out with a bottle filled.
[00:58:27.900 --> 00:58:30.740]   And he said, this is all the sperm I can get in two hours.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:33.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.820]   Oh, I went back to bed, went to sleep,
[00:58:35.820 --> 00:58:39.220]   and I dreamt that I was taking care of some pet fish.
[00:58:39.220 --> 00:58:41.040]   And I put them in the oven with some wild fish,
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:41.940]   and I forgot about the oven.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:43.620]   I thought, they're all cooking.
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.740]   And I opened it to save them,
[00:58:44.740 --> 00:58:46.100]   and there they were looking back at me
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.860]   with intelligent human eyes.
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:49.780]   And one of them turned into John Malkovich,
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:52.720]   who seemed completely indifferent to being saved.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:58:55.720 --> 00:59:00.760]   The next day, I decided to say goodbye, like a man.
[00:59:00.760 --> 00:59:02.780]   If I couldn't be one, I would imitate one.
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:05.700]   Goodbye, mates.
[00:59:05.700 --> 00:59:06.700]   Hey, I'll work with you again.
[00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:08.460]   Hey, big guys, good working with you.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:10.280]   Hey, look out, watch out for those whores.
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:11.540]   Come on.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:14.620]   Hey, watch it now, we'll work again.
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:16.340]   Okay, righto, righto.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:17.580]   Oh no, no, no, no, no.
[00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.660]   And I got to Athol Fugard, and Athol went,
[00:59:20.660 --> 00:59:22.760]   so, you're leaving paradise, Spalding?
[00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:27.060]   And I said, oh, Athol, oh, I was thinking about,
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:32.860]   you know, I said, ah, no, I said, go,
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:34.620]   return to Renee.
[00:59:34.620 --> 00:59:36.100]   She's a lovely lady.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:37.100]   Go back to her.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.460]   Take what you've learned here back.
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:41.620]   You know it's all the same.
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:42.880]   I wanted to believe him.
[00:59:42.880 --> 00:59:45.220]   I wanted to believe him.
[00:59:45.220 --> 00:59:46.540]   And I got on the plane with Tom Bird,
[00:59:46.540 --> 00:59:47.940]   and we flew back to Bangkok,
[00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:49.840]   and Tom rushed off to the Vietnamese embassies
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:51.880]   and asked them if we could go to Vietnam.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.940]   I rushed off to John Malkovich's tailor
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.980]   over on Silam Road, and I said,
[00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:58.240]   you know that suit John Malkovich had made here?
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:01.100]   The one that kind of looks sloppy, but almost neat?
[01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.060]   You know, it looks like a parachute.
[01:00:03.060 --> 01:00:03.940]   Oh, it's fantastic.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:05.400]   You know that one?
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:07.500]   Oh yes, he designed it himself.
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.660]   I said, would you make me one something like it?
[01:00:10.660 --> 01:00:13.260]   Oh, surely Mr. Gray can afford two suits at this price.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.340]   All right, make me a brown one and a gray one.
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.280]   And also, you know that shirt he brought in from Paris
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:19.480]   that he had copies made here?
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:20.540]   Three of those.
[01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.540]   I went back to the hotel,
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:24.100]   and Tom said that the Vietnamese say
[01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.580]   it's gonna take about four more days,
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:26.960]   and we'll have to wait.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:29.840]   Oh shit, we had gone down to the beach,
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:30.680]   everything worked out.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:31.500]   Are we gonna wait or what?
[01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.820]   No.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:35.780]   I've got to get back to Sis, Tom's girlfriend Sis.
[01:00:35.780 --> 01:00:38.100]   We rented a house together in Bridgehampton
[01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:39.420]   for the summer with some other people.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:40.900]   I've really got to get back.
[01:00:40.900 --> 01:00:43.060]   Shit, now I realized I was riding
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:46.380]   on his love slash libido carpet,
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.060]   no longer the Magic Will carpet,
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:49.140]   and I couldn't talk him out of it.
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:51.920]   I said, Tom, listen, let's go down to Pot Pong tonight
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:53.820]   and just, you know, at least if you can't work it out
[01:00:53.820 --> 01:00:55.460]   love-wise, at least sexually, you know,
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:57.660]   get some of the old pressure off the old pressure cooker.
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:59.420]   Let's go down and get a couple of Thai gals.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.060]   I have my friend down there, Joy, and you get one.
[01:01:02.060 --> 01:01:03.820]   No, I was there twice during the war.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:06.140]   I got gonorrhea twice, I'm not interested.
[01:01:06.140 --> 01:01:07.340]   I said, would you come down with me
[01:01:07.340 --> 01:01:08.640]   so I can say goodbye to Joy
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.120]   if it really means we're going?
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.620]   So it was a last night fling and we went down.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:14.180]   Joy was there and she was smiling
[01:01:14.180 --> 01:01:15.320]   and I brought her back to the hotel
[01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:16.820]   and we spent the night together.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.660]   And I realized really it wasn't working out.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:19.580]   It never worked out.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:22.140]   80% of erotic love for me really is language
[01:01:22.140 --> 01:01:23.700]   in and around the event.
[01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:25.700]   I mean, if you can't talk about it, really.
[01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:27.840]   I mean, in two basic intentions of sex,
[01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:30.340]   a pleasurable release and some noticeable change
[01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:31.360]   in the other.
[01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:33.860]   I wasn't noticing the change.
[01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:35.480]   I figured she was acting that way
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.580]   because I was paying her.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.620]   And we couldn't even talk about the relationship of money
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:39.780]   because we couldn't talk.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:42.060]   And so once it was over, you lay there in the dark
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.220]   and the only thing she could say and admire her English
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:49.220]   was, Joy, like you, with a great ear-to-ear smile.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.100]   I'd say, oh, come on, I wanted to say,
[01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:52.280]   I bet you say that to all the guys,
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:53.700]   but I wanted to believe it.
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:54.540]   And in the morning, I'd get up
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:56.100]   and there'd be a fresh bowl of fruit there
[01:01:56.100 --> 01:01:57.820]   and I wanted to feed her and I'd go,
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:59.780]   Joy, want banana?
[01:01:59.780 --> 01:02:02.980]   And she'd say, Joy, like you.
[01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:05.580]   And then she'd giggle and hide under the pillow.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.340]   She could fit under the pillow.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:09.060]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:10.580]   I said, come on, Joy, it's time to go.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:11.780]   I'm going back to New York City.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:13.960]   I was just talking away and I got her down to the cab.
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:16.020]   She was like a little Minnie Mouse on high heels.
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:17.260]   I helped her into the cab
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:18.660]   and then she pushed me into the cab.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:19.920]   Instead, I ran back to the hotel
[01:02:19.920 --> 01:02:21.340]   and the glass doors opened and closed
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:23.420]   and she waved goodbye as though she lived there.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.680]   And I was the prostitute.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.100]   I said, no, no, no, no, Joy.
[01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:28.420]   No, no, no.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:29.940]   Now come, come, come, got her in the cab,
[01:02:29.940 --> 01:02:31.700]   sent her off, goodbye forever.
[01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:33.620]   Tom and I went down and bought the tranquilizers.
[01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:35.140]   You buy them in Thailand, over the counter,
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.580]   no prescription necessary, all the valumes you want.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.240]   Gobbled them down, the driver picked us up
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.220]   for that last ride to the airplane.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.020]   We got on the airplane, we were in business class
[01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.260]   up there in that high compartment.
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.460]   I've never ridden there since.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:47.600]   I've always wanted to, haven't, fantastic.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:49.740]   It's like you're in this flying motel.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.620]   You don't hear any sound, you don't hear the engines.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.780]   You're protected up there.
[01:02:52.780 --> 01:02:54.180]   Pulled down the sleep mask.
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:58.660]   I don't remember anything but, oh, Karachi by night.
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.860]   Mm, buying a three dollar cup of coffee
[01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.340]   in the Frankfurt airport.
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:04.780]   Ah, trying to buy a bottle of vodka,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.080]   Russian vodka at Heathrow.
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:07.900]   The woman's trying to sell me Smirnoffs.
[01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:09.560]   I'm saying, lady, this is made in New Jersey.
[01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:12.140]   She's saying, no, I know it's real Russian vodka.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:17.140]   Ah, America.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:21.780]   I get off the plane, oh my God, are we ugly.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.740]   I had forgotten New York City was bad.
[01:03:23.740 --> 01:03:25.900]   Crumbville was worse.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.580]   And I thought I was gonna do all this stuff.
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.300]   When I got back, I made these promises.
[01:03:29.300 --> 01:03:31.880]   First of all, I was gonna wash the windows of my loft,
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.980]   pay my taxes, go to the dentist,
[01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:35.700]   get all of my sweaters out.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:37.380]   This is all before I got a Hollywood agent.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:38.980]   Get all my sweaters out and take them
[01:03:38.980 --> 01:03:41.420]   to the Cambodian refugees in Far Rockaway
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.660]   that I have heard are so confused
[01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:43.900]   by the New York subway system
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.920]   that they walk on the beltway into Chinatown to buy rice.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.500]   I saw myself marching with them.
[01:03:48.500 --> 01:03:52.380]   Ah, going down the highway, everything was gonna work out.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:53.320]   Nothing was happening.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.160]   I was paralyzed.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:55.180]   We got up in Crumbville.
[01:03:55.180 --> 01:03:56.580]   The people were uglier up there.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:03:58.780]   I saw all the hardwood trees as palm trees.
[01:03:58.780 --> 01:04:01.460]   At night, I was dreaming of magic mushrooms and taking them,
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:02.980]   and why didn't I stay and take them?
[01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.860]   And I was treating Rene like a Thai whore,
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:07.840]   and I was, rah, and I couldn't stand shopping, rah,
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:08.680]   and I didn't want to cook.
[01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:09.780]   I wanted someone to cook for me,
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:12.900]   and I was, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:17.020]   And Rene said, Spald, you know, get it together.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:19.900]   (audience laughing)
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:20.940]   You're gonna lose it.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.600]   Remember how you were gonna come back and get an agent?
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.700]   Remember how you did a feature film?
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.020]   Now, we're in Crumbville.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.520]   Now, I don't think we're gonna make exactly
[01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:30.600]   what we call great connections up here.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:34.680]   I think we should go down to Bridgehampton for the weekend,
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.560]   'cause Sis and Tom invited us down to their house, you know?
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:39.720]   I had phoned back with Tom,
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.240]   and he had said, come down any time.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.080]   You know, get back to your ocean.
[01:04:43.080 --> 01:04:43.920]   Get down.
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.160]   All right, all right, all right, we'll do it.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.040]   We'll do it.
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.880]   Anything to get out of Crumbville.
[01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:49.600]   Get down there.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.660]   It's not as though I had never been
[01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:51.800]   to the Hamptons in the summer.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:53.560]   It's not as though I didn't know what it was like.
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.700]   I had seen it enough on the Michelob ads.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.180]   I'd seen enough in Michelob.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.020]   I arrived.
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.460]   It was just like they were filming one.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:03.260]   It's this beautiful house on a quarter acre of land.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.580]   It's one of those beautiful old American family houses
[01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.360]   where in the old days, when there were American families,
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:08.760]   they would have lived in it.
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.220]   Now, it's filled with couples about to break up,
[01:05:11.220 --> 01:05:12.780]   singles that had just broken up.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:13.920]   They'd all got together, you know,
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:15.640]   'cause they didn't have enough money to rent the house.
[01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:16.980]   To rent it, they'd all pitched in.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:20.320]   So, it was this kind of, you know, contemporary situation,
[01:05:20.320 --> 01:05:21.520]   a kind of big chill factor.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:25.100]   And we're all out there playing volleyball like this.
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:25.940]   It's fun.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.100]   And I feel the only thing is they're toking up
[01:05:28.100 --> 01:05:28.940]   to play volleyball.
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:30.300]   I can't believe that the ball just doesn't turn
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.180]   into a seagull in front of them and fly away.
[01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:35.820]   Beside the net is a cooler.
[01:05:35.820 --> 01:05:37.620]   And in it are all recognizable cans,
[01:05:37.620 --> 01:05:41.300]   Diet Pepsi taps, open it, and Michelob's open it,
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.140]   Lowenbrau's open.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:43.620]   And I'm feeling I'm in charge of the bluefish.
[01:05:43.620 --> 01:05:44.480]   I know about bluefish.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:45.780]   Hey, that's my territory.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.100]   I grew up in Rhode Island.
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.780]   Bluefish, I'll take, I'll buy it, I'll cook it.
[01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.100]   The guy in charge of the coals, though,
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.160]   he was a little out of sync with me.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:54.380]   And I kept having to put more napalm on
[01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.940]   to try to get the coals up high enough to cook the bluefish.
[01:05:56.940 --> 01:05:59.420]   And then everything suddenly went prehistoric.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:02.080]   And I don't remember what happened in between,
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:04.080]   but I do remember sitting at a very large table
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:06.500]   with a white tablecloth and a candle opera in the middle,
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.040]   and about six people around it saying,
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:11.100]   would anyone like some more bluefish sushi?
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:13.740]   And I am saying, no thanks.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:15.100]   I've got all I can eat right here,
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.840]   looking down at my hand on a white plate
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:18.060]   that looks like a piece of chicken.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.040]   And the tan is peeling off, you know.
[01:06:20.040 --> 01:06:22.260]   Hallucinogenically, and I just go.
[01:06:22.260 --> 01:06:24.900]   (screams)
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.900]   My head goes down in Rene's lap, and I go,
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.820]   oh my God, something awful has happened.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:32.060]   I'm supposed to be in Thailand.
[01:06:32.060 --> 01:06:33.140]   Nothing's gonna go right.
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.980]   I'm out of time, I'm out of sync.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.100]   And I fled from the table.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.240]   Behind me, people were talking about
[01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:39.140]   the gasoline-flavored bluefish sushi.
[01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:41.620]   And I fled like Konstantin Gorilovich from the seagull
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:43.180]   out onto the porch and collapsed
[01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:46.420]   into total state of Russian despair into the hammock.
[01:06:46.420 --> 01:06:47.860]   And Rene came out to comfort me.
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:49.500]   I said, Rene, something awful has happened.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:51.600]   I vote to be in Thailand, it was a mission.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.740]   It wasn't just a film.
[01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.640]   I was there for a very important reason.
[01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:57.100]   Something was about to be revealed to me on that beach.
[01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:58.400]   We were gonna go to Hanoi.
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:06:59.880]   It was a mission, it was a mission.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:02.720]   And over me, Tom Bird, that great ex-Vietnam vet,
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.340]   is standing over the hammock going,
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:07.620]   Spalding, be here now.
[01:07:07.620 --> 01:07:08.460]   (audience laughs)
[01:07:08.460 --> 01:07:10.920]   I fall back in the hammock, and my face comes back,
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.660]   and now it's completely falling off.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:14.720]   It's 90 years old, and I have no teeth,
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.900]   and I'm going, Tom, Tom, why couldn't you go to the beach,
[01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:20.900]   man, what were you feeling guilty about?
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.800]   I know you killed the Vietnamese.
[01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:23.800]   Why am I guilty?
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:24.800]   I know why you're guilty.
[01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:25.700]   It was a mission.
[01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.680]   Spalding, be here now.
[01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:32.240]   Do you think I want to be here?
[01:07:32.240 --> 01:07:37.480]   (audience laughs)
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.520]   Suddenly I realized this strong,
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:41.620]   silent man was also suffering.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.920]   He just knew how to shut up about it.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.760]   (audience laughs)
[01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:53.200]   Oh, I thought I better get together fast.
[01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:55.240]   I owe it to them quickly, quickly, quickly.
[01:07:55.240 --> 01:07:56.540]   People came in to the party.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.700]   They'd just come in from sailing off Block Island.
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.640]   My lord, Block Island, that's my territory.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.800]   I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.900]   I was born with the name Spalding Gray.
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.480]   What was I doing in Crumville at 42 years old?
[01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.320]   And it all hit me in a flash, in a very heavy flash,
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:13.280]   that it was too late now to become a doctor,
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:15.860]   a dentist, a lawyer, a psychiatrist.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.320]   All of that was over.
[01:08:18.780 --> 01:08:20.800]   But I could come to Hollywood and play one
[01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:22.360]   and make twice as much.
[01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:24.300]   (audience laughs)
[01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.300]   So now it was time to make the decision,
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.000]   get my act together, straighten it out,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.460]   come out here and get an agent.
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:30.900]   So in order to be more decisive,
[01:08:30.900 --> 01:08:32.800]   I went out and bought that tape.
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.880]   You've heard it, the decision-making cassette,
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.180]   How to Make Decisions.
[01:08:36.180 --> 01:08:37.540]   (audience laughs)
[01:08:37.540 --> 01:08:40.720]   Success series unlimited, the hypnotic tape.
[01:08:40.720 --> 01:08:41.720]   It's fantastic.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.520]   Every night we put on the earphones
[01:08:43.520 --> 01:08:45.120]   and listen to it and they hypnotize you
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.760]   and they give you suggestions of how to be more decisive.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.220]   In the morning you have a glass of water right by the bed
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:52.720]   and you drink that water completely down
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:56.060]   and you wash all of this stuff into your unconscious.
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:56.900]   And it works.
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:08:57.760]   (audience laughs)
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:58.600]   It works.
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:02.600]   I testify, lo and behold, I was becoming more decisive.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.860]   And around the time that I was becoming more decisive,
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:07.880]   I was asked to do a project under the Brooklyn Bridge
[01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.340]   for the Brooklyn Bridge Centennial
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:11.440]   interviewing people under the Brooklyn Bridge
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:13.480]   about their relationships to the bridge.
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:16.140]   I mean, you know, under the bridge.
[01:09:16.140 --> 01:09:18.360]   Not exactly a great career choice.
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.460]   (audience laughs)
[01:09:20.460 --> 01:09:23.380]   But a sane way back into show business.
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:25.820]   And also it was causing a lot of attention.
[01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:27.560]   And a woman called me up, I hope Noah,
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:30.560]   from WMCA Talk Radio, and she wanted to interview me
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.940]   about the Brooklyn Bridge event and the killing field.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:33.940]   So a great combination,
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:35.200]   Brooklyn Bridge and the killing field.
[01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.540]   (audience laughs)
[01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:40.140]   So I'm going to come on her show and I get on the show.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:42.880]   And she tells me that she remembers me from college
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.120]   and she can't wait to see me again.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:46.400]   I can't put it together, the name and anything else.
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.360]   And I get on the show and the first person that's on
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:50.740]   is a woman talking about a new consciousness raising club
[01:09:50.740 --> 01:09:52.300]   that she has started for older women
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:54.560]   that are in love with younger men, or so many of those now.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.400]   They need to get together
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.780]   and raise their consciousness about it.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:58.320]   (audience laughs)
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:09:59.440]   Then the next person that's on
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.600]   is a woman that has found a cure for baldness.
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:04.080]   And I really perk up at this one.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.320]   We do not inherit a tendency toward baldness,
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.160]   according to her.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.580]   We inherit a tendency toward oil in the pores.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:11.860]   (audience laughs)
[01:10:11.860 --> 01:10:14.940]   And for $2,000, money back guarantee,
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:17.040]   you can get a shampoo that will remove that oil.
[01:10:17.040 --> 01:10:18.200]   And this is important to remove it
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.080]   because underneath the oil, down on the follicles,
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:21.740]   is growing fully grown hairs,
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:24.120]   all wrapped up and curled up like little pubies.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:25.860]   (audience laughs)
[01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:27.940]   Like little pig's tails, like a little corkscrew.
[01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:29.560]   And all you have to do is remove that oil
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.780]   and up they come, these new hairs, full blown.
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:34.500]   And you've seen men that have just had them come up,
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:35.380]   they were like shredded wheat,
[01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.400]   they've raked them all the way across.
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:40.020]   And so I'm listening and then it's my turn.
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:42.120]   I come on, I come on, and she says,
[01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.960]   "Hi everyone, it's Hope Noah for Singles Only.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:47.560]   "I want everyone at home that's single to say hi to me,
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:51.880]   "I'm happy to be single, and just hug yourself, okay?
[01:10:51.880 --> 01:10:56.560]   "I want to introduce to you Spalding Gray,
[01:10:56.560 --> 01:11:00.840]   "star of stage, screen, and television, hi, come on in."
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:02.640]   I don't know where she got my resume from,
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.600]   I don't know what was going on.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.480]   She said, "I'll never forget Spalding,"
[01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:06.920]   and by the way, Spalding and I
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.080]   went to the same school together,
[01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:10.760]   so I never will forget the first time we met.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.280]   I said, "You're going to have to help me out
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:15.340]   "in that one home."
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.660]   (audience laughing)
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.420]   Now I know that's why I don't have a house in the Hamptons.
[01:11:21.420 --> 01:11:23.900]   That's the major problem, so I've got to really
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:25.940]   go along with it, and I was.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:27.140]   I started to fall right into it.
[01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:28.620]   We started talking about the killing field,
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:30.700]   so I could tell by her face,
[01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.980]   and probably her listening audience,
[01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:34.800]   it was like talking about cancer before you had a cure.
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.700]   So she changed the subject very quickly.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:39.680]   Well, tell us about, what's the difference
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.680]   between film acting and television acting, in your opinion?
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.780]   I mean, just for the record,
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:46.180]   why don't you tell our listening audience
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:48.280]   what films have they seen you in recently?
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.320]   (audience laughing)
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:53.660]   I thought, here it goes.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:55.620]   Time for fiction.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:58.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.200]   I'm going to get that house in the Hamptons.
[01:12:02.200 --> 01:12:04.140]   I'm going to make myself up, you know?
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.740]   Well, I don't know if it's my favorite,
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.400]   and the most recent and most successful one
[01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.880]   was called Leftover Life to Kill.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.380]   (audience laughing)
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.860]   It's the story of Dylan Thomas,
[01:12:12.860 --> 01:12:14.920]   and actually the demise and death of Dylan Thomas
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:16.880]   and his wife's life afterwards.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.680]   I played a lesser American poet that came over to visit
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:21.680]   Dylan Thomas' wife at her boathouse there,
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.700]   and I don't know if any of your audience have seen it.
[01:12:23.700 --> 01:12:25.820]   It's a Welch cult film that shows
[01:12:25.820 --> 01:12:27.180]   in Welch theaters at midnight.
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:30.180]   (audience laughing)
[01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.420]   Then Time of the Assassins.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.540]   Oh, boy, that was a great film.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:35.900]   That Rambo, what a character.
[01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:38.420]   He gave up writing poetry at 19 and became a gun runner.
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:39.900]   I played a lesser American poet
[01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:41.460]   (audience laughing)
[01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.280]   that came over to visit him on his deathbed.
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:46.100]   He had all of his money hidden in some sort of fake leg,
[01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:48.460]   and then that hasn't been released yet.
[01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:49.740]   It was shot in southern France.
[01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:50.880]   Then I get further out on the limb
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.020]   because I'm getting carried away,
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:55.220]   and I said, oh, I played a romantic lead, Canadian Sunset.
[01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:57.520]   I was a ski bum, and oh, really?
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.740]   She said, now, where was that film?
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:00.460]   I couldn't think of any Canadian cities,
[01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.140]   and the first thing that came to mind was Toronto,
[01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:03.860]   and she pushes me off the edge of the branch
[01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.020]   and says, Toronto?
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:06.560]   I thought that was totally flat country.
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:08.060]   Do they have much skiing up there?
[01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:09.220]   I said, as a matter of fact, you're right.
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:10.420]   That's very perceptive.
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.940]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:15.900]   I see you know your Canadian cities.
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:18.460]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:20.380]   But they don't.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:23.480]   But the point is that the film built a mountain for it.
[01:13:23.480 --> 01:13:26.480]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.180]   Basically, that is the difference
[01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.180]   between television acting and film acting.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:34.140]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:34.140 --> 01:13:36.300]   The television goes to the mountain, you see,
[01:13:36.300 --> 01:13:38.660]   and the film brings the mountain to them.
[01:13:38.660 --> 01:13:39.960]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:41.300]   Now, I felt successful.
[01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:42.140]   I got through.
[01:13:42.140 --> 01:13:42.960]   I made myself up.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.460]   I've seen people make themselves up like that.
[01:13:44.460 --> 01:13:46.940]   I've seen people come religious leaders in five minutes
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:47.980]   and have a following.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:49.740]   Richard Schechner and I, back in the old days,
[01:13:49.740 --> 01:13:51.660]   you know, when the Hare Krishna's would chant in the Bowery,
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:53.180]   and by the time they reached Central Park,
[01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.900]   they were six inches off the ground.
[01:13:54.900 --> 01:13:57.060]   Richard and I were up at Bethesda Fountain in Central Park
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:13:58.140]   on a lovely May day,
[01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:00.020]   and those Hare Krishna's came down those steps.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:00.860]   They were floating.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:01.940]   They were really levitating.
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:03.260]   And they began chanting,
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:05.020]   and 200 people gathered around them,
[01:14:05.020 --> 01:14:06.780]   250 people easily,
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:08.060]   and Richard got jealous.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:09.500]   And he took off all his clothes,
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:10.660]   except for his jockey shorts,
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:12.280]   took out his Indian prayer shawl,
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.460]   asked me to hold his clothes and stand in the corner,
[01:14:14.460 --> 01:14:16.340]   while he proceeded to stand on his head.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.460]   Well, that entire crowd left the Hare Krishna's
[01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.580]   and gathered around Richard.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.740]   They were in so close.
[01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.660]   He could see only the palms of his feet,
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.460]   the bottom of his feet, the soles.
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.300]   I thought it was,
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:27.420]   it was like a suddenly last summer situation.
[01:14:27.420 --> 01:14:29.580]   I thought they were really going to eat him alive
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.020]   as a kind of sacrifice.
[01:14:31.020 --> 01:14:33.580]   They were sticking Italian ices
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:36.220]   down through the holes in his underwear.
[01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:38.900]   He got so panicked that he pulled out of this thing,
[01:14:38.900 --> 01:14:40.060]   and he came running over to me.
[01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:40.940]   He said, "Quick, get me dressed.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:41.780]   "Let's get out of here."
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:44.500]   He had a following of 25 disciples going,
[01:14:44.500 --> 01:14:46.340]   "Ah, ah, ah, ah.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:47.400]   "When will you return?"
[01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.360]   Really, he was saying, "I will return.
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:50.260]   "I will be back.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:51.180]   "Where are you going now?"
[01:14:51.180 --> 01:14:52.020]   Some guy said.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.340]   He said, "I'm walking east."
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:54.980]   (audience laughing)
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.380]   He could have walked into the East River,
[01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.540]   and they would have followed.
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:14:59.900]   He made himself up in an afternoon like that.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.260]   Sri Ramakrishna, all right,
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:02.380]   he really didn't make himself up,
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:03.980]   but you know Sri Ramakrishna
[01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:05.660]   was the last great Indian saint,
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:07.500]   the last great poor Indian saint
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.660]   that didn't have 29 Rolls Royces.
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.660]   Sri Ramakrishna, 1864.
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:13.820]   This man never knew who he was.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:15.540]   He called himself Sri Ramakrishna,
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.820]   but when he was worshiping Christ,
[01:15:16.820 --> 01:15:18.220]   he became Christ.
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:19.820]   When he was doing tantric practices,
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:22.220]   he got totally lost in that unity,
[01:15:22.220 --> 01:15:23.220]   sexual unity.
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:25.340]   He became a woman when he was worshiping Mother Kali.
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.060]   They thought he was a woman at the temple.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.500]   They couldn't tell he was a man.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.660]   He at last, finally some naked madman,
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:31.620]   ran out of the woods
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.980]   and stuck a stone between his eyes
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:34.460]   and he saw nothing.
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:36.260]   You know, he had no sense of who he was.
[01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:37.100]   It didn't matter.
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.340]   He didn't have to go to a psychiatrist
[01:15:38.340 --> 01:15:39.780]   because he lived in India.
[01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:42.140]   But in a way, he was a kind of actor.
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.380]   Now, who are our holy people here?
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:46.500]   Who are holy people, holy men and women?
[01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:47.900]   Actors and actresses.
[01:15:47.900 --> 01:15:49.140]   Peter Sellars, the actor,
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.100]   he never knew who he was, he said.
[01:15:51.100 --> 01:15:52.340]   Voices came through him.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.500]   He was an open conduit
[01:15:53.500 --> 01:15:55.060]   and these voices and rolls came through him.
[01:15:55.060 --> 01:15:56.420]   He had to go to a psychiatrist
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:57.860]   because he lived in the West.
[01:15:57.860 --> 01:15:59.220]   But where does the holy actor go,
[01:15:59.220 --> 01:16:00.500]   the holy man or holy woman
[01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:02.300]   that's an actor or an actress?
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.140]   Where is Mecca?
[01:16:03.140 --> 01:16:04.100]   Hollywood.
[01:16:04.100 --> 01:16:05.180]   What is eternal life?
[01:16:05.180 --> 01:16:07.420]   The celluloid in a materialistic world, of course,
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.620]   who lived forever on the film.
[01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:09.500]   Who is God?
[01:16:09.500 --> 01:16:12.060]   The camera, of course, the omniscient third eye.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:13.300]   It was time to go.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.340]   I put on the magic John Malkovich suit,
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.340]   the brown one,
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:19.340]   took my Thai bot and converted it into American money,
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:21.300]   bought a TWA flight to Hollywood.
[01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:23.300]   I was going to choose an agent.
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:24.140]   I get on the plane,
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:25.740]   I'm dressed in my suit, fantastic.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:28.020]   I'm wrestling with that fucking little salad packet,
[01:16:28.020 --> 01:16:30.300]   this fucking little salad dressing packet.
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.340]   Oh shit, oh god damn it, why?
[01:16:33.340 --> 01:16:35.500]   Every time I put on a suit once a month,
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.060]   the chewing gum fly to me and stick.
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:40.340]   (audience laughing)
[01:16:40.340 --> 01:16:41.180]   The guy next to me says,
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.860]   "It's all right, don't worry about it, don't worry about it.
[01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:45.780]   "Just make sure it's color fast, you know.
[01:16:45.780 --> 01:16:47.220]   "Just take it in and you'll get some club soda.
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.100]   "Take it in as soon as you get to wherever you're going."
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:51.060]   Where'd you have the suit made?
[01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:51.900]   Bangkok.
[01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:53.260]   Well, I don't know.
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.860]   (audience laughing)
[01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.780]   So I get to, I'm staying in,
[01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.780]   I'm very excited because I'm staying in Venice for the first,
[01:16:59.780 --> 01:17:01.860]   I'm very excited to be out in Hollywood
[01:17:01.860 --> 01:17:02.940]   because it's a,
[01:17:02.940 --> 01:17:05.820]   Los Angeles is a city that's accessible to an ocean.
[01:17:05.820 --> 01:17:07.580]   This is very unusual outside of Vancouver.
[01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.860]   I mean, New York takes ever to get to the ocean,
[01:17:09.860 --> 01:17:11.300]   but here it is and it's beautiful
[01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:13.700]   and we're down in Venice and the sea breezes are blowing
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:16.340]   and I can't wait to get to the boardwalk.
[01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:19.020]   I take my suit into the cleaner and I go down.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:20.820]   I'm a little disappointed to find there's no boards
[01:17:20.820 --> 01:17:21.860]   on the boardwalk,
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.620]   but it's nice, it's still beautiful.
[01:17:23.620 --> 01:17:26.540]   And I'm walking along and an unmarked car pulls up by me
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.820]   and two unmarked men jump out,
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:29.780]   open the doors like this
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:32.260]   and breaks two chrome 45s on the door.
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:34.580]   And they're aiming them at two innocent winos
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:35.740]   who are drunk on their asses.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:38.620]   And I think, is this a movie?
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:40.140]   Am I in Hill Street Blues?
[01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.780]   I duck behind the pizza counter.
[01:17:41.780 --> 01:17:44.180]   They go over and put the guns to these guys' temples,
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:46.140]   handcuff them with their hands behind their backs,
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.980]   drive their knees into the men's back.
[01:17:47.980 --> 01:17:49.900]   I think, shit, this is dangerous territory.
[01:17:49.900 --> 01:17:51.380]   I better go get my suit on.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.620]   I go back, the suit isn't ready, but it's cocktail hour.
[01:17:53.620 --> 01:17:54.900]   I always celebrate cocktail hour
[01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.340]   whenever I'm not doing a monologue.
[01:17:56.340 --> 01:17:57.860]   And I went down to this bodega,
[01:17:57.860 --> 01:17:59.140]   a little side street in Venice
[01:17:59.140 --> 01:18:01.740]   to buy a king-sized scan of Rainier Ale.
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.540]   I'm on a 10-speed bike.
[01:18:03.540 --> 01:18:04.820]   I get out, I can't wait.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.500]   I just start juggaloaking it, brown bagging right outside.
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:08.340]   It's a side road.
[01:18:08.340 --> 01:18:10.940]   An LAPD car goes by, a cruiser full speed.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:12.500]   It does a U-turn.
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:16.020]   I think, my God, are these guys really coming for me?
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.660]   It was like beer radar.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:19.580]   (audience laughing)
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:21.140]   That's how quickly they picked up on me.
[01:18:21.140 --> 01:18:22.180]   It was like, someone call the police.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:24.820]   Get that man drinking out of the brown bag.
[01:18:24.820 --> 01:18:27.060]   I see all these empty cans beside me in a box.
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:28.420]   I quickly throw it in.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:30.780]   They pull up and put a searchlight from the car.
[01:18:30.780 --> 01:18:32.060]   Aim it on this box.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.340]   They come over and take out
[01:18:33.340 --> 01:18:36.260]   the very Rainier Ale can I was drinking from.
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:37.540]   They throw me against a wall.
[01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:38.460]   I've got my hands up.
[01:18:38.460 --> 01:18:39.580]   They've got clubs out.
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:40.660]   They're searching, what's your name?
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:41.500]   Spaulding Gray.
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.340]   What do they call you?
[01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.780]   Spaulding Gray, I swear it.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:46.540]   My ID is back at the house where you're staying.
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.020]   I remembered it, I was getting better.
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.540]   Not like Las Vegas this time.
[01:18:49.540 --> 01:18:52.100]   Six days in jail and $285 bond.
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.620]   This time I remembered it.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:56.780]   927 Boccaccio.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:58.580]   All right, we're going to take you there.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.300]   By the way, my partner wants to search you first
[01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:03.140]   because we both like to do our own searches
[01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:03.980]   before you get in the car.
[01:19:03.980 --> 01:19:05.580]   Put the bike in the back.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:06.420]   All right, come on.
[01:19:06.420 --> 01:19:07.820]   We get to Boccaccio this day.
[01:19:07.820 --> 01:19:08.660]   People knew me.
[01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:10.220]   They knew me, luckily, that night.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.940]   And I had to stay in the car until I was verified.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:14.100]   And then they came out.
[01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:16.340]   And he said, okay boy, you can get your bike out.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.460]   You're lucky you got a free ride.
[01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:18.940]   Hey, I don't want to get testy with you guys,
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:21.220]   but the truth is, I just flew in from New York City.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.380]   And in New York City, you won't be.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:23.500]   (mumbles)
[01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:24.340]   Yeah.
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:25.380]   Well, I think if you check the laws in New York,
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:27.300]   you'll find out it's against the law to drink in the streets.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.660]   We just happen to enforce our laws here in Los Angeles.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:33.020]   (audience laughing)
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:34.220]   Right to bed.
[01:19:34.220 --> 01:19:37.220]   (audience laughing)
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.940]   I went right to bed and the next day I got up,
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.940]   I didn't waste any more time.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:43.260]   I was so thankful not to be in jail for another seven days.
[01:19:43.260 --> 01:19:44.620]   I went out and I got my suit.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:45.460]   It was ready.
[01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.940]   This time I'm going to get my agent.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:48.860]   Got the ugly duckling.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.620]   I rented an ugly duckling at Toyota.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:51.460]   It was fine.
[01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:52.300]   It was decent.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.140]   The seat was a little broken.
[01:19:53.140 --> 01:19:54.380]   It was back so far that I was just barely
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.580]   over the windshield.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.140]   And I was going to choose now.
[01:19:57.140 --> 01:19:59.340]   I decided writers and artists, if they wanted me,
[01:19:59.340 --> 01:20:01.500]   I had chosen two that I'd boil it down to.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.060]   Writers and artists, nice people,
[01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.740]   but a little bit too much like my people.
[01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:06.180]   You know, they would wear topsiders,
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.740]   wasps, they would go to Martha's Vineyard
[01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:10.700]   and Nantucket for their vacation.
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:12.060]   Sweet people, but I just didn't know
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.500]   if it was the right thing to go under the title
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.100]   of writers and artists in this day and age
[01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:16.300]   if you wanted to make money.
[01:20:16.300 --> 01:20:18.220]   And also I thought I should try to get someone
[01:20:18.220 --> 01:20:19.180]   who was a little more pushy,
[01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:21.220]   someone other than I, a little more ballsy.
[01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:22.700]   So the other one was Susan Smith,
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:24.020]   Smith Friedman Agency.
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.540]   So I thought I'd go with Susan Smith if she wanted me.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.460]   And I got down to her office and I walked in
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.380]   and she's had a big smile and she said,
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:33.100]   we want you, we want to sign you right now.
[01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:34.580]   I said, oh great.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:37.660]   She said, would you smile if we said we didn't want you?
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:42.660]   And I said, oh, all right, I'll do it, I'll sign.
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.100]   And I signed it.
[01:20:44.100 --> 01:20:46.540]   I signed all the papers and they sent me out with a map
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.100]   and said, all right, now you're going to this person
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.940]   and this person say hi, I'm a new face in town.
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.900]   I'm with the Smith Friedman Agency and that's all.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.940]   Just get to know people, casting agents
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.340]   and we're gonna begin to get you some work.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.980]   So they give me a map and I'm off.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.060]   I'm cruising along, everything is fine.
[01:21:00.060 --> 01:21:01.500]   I'm realizing now why people have
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:03.860]   air conditioned cars in Hollywood.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:06.340]   My shirt is sticking to me, the sweat is coming through.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:09.020]   My hair is a little frizzed from the 102 degree temperature
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:09.860]   like a sauna.
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:13.220]   I'm looking a little mad and I'm spitting on it
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.980]   each time I stop to try to get it down,
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:17.220]   very conscious of looking in the mirror
[01:21:17.220 --> 01:21:18.980]   because when you come in to see these casting agents,
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:20.620]   they say, we just wanted to take a look at you.
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:21.820]   They really mean that.
[01:21:21.820 --> 01:21:23.940]   (audience laughing)
[01:21:23.940 --> 01:21:25.460]   I have never known what it was like
[01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:28.580]   to be scrutinized before, it's the other side of the coin.
[01:21:28.580 --> 01:21:32.300]   And so I'm cruising along and the first place I go to is,
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:34.300]   hey, they're sending me up a karate kid.
[01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.100]   They want me to play the role of the killer,
[01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.740]   the real tough guy that teaches all the kids
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.020]   how to do the karate.
[01:21:39.020 --> 01:21:41.660]   You can imagine how that went.
[01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:43.860]   (audience laughing)
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:46.500]   Then on to Hill Street Blues, Jerry Windsor, very nice.
[01:21:46.500 --> 01:21:47.980]   She said, if you come out here, we'll give you work.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:50.300]   Surely you could probably get six weeks at the guest slot.
[01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.300]   I said, really great, but we can't afford to fly you out.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.900]   Well, how could you tell me that you would give me work?
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:55.140]   I mean, you don't know me in any way.
[01:21:55.140 --> 01:21:56.140]   Well, we need a new face.
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:58.420]   We're looking for new faces and you're with a good agency.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:01.300]   Off to ABC, NBC, I met them all.
[01:22:01.300 --> 01:22:03.380]   Go in, occasionally the receptionist would recognize me
[01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.500]   and say, Spaulding Gray, I saw your monologues
[01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.340]   when you were out here.
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:07.580]   What are you doing looking for work?
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.060]   You could work all the time if you wanted.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:10.620]   You could play a doctor, you could play a lawyer,
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:13.020]   you could play a dentist, you could play a psychiatrist.
[01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:15.300]   You should be working all the time.
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:16.620]   Then I go into the gassing agency.
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.100]   They don't know me in there at all, you see,
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.540]   but I'm put at ease by them.
[01:22:20.540 --> 01:22:21.380]   I like them.
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:23.740]   They're very, even though they're doing
[01:22:23.740 --> 01:22:26.860]   a little scrutinizing, I love the way their offices
[01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.180]   come together in clean, white, solid, right angles.
[01:22:29.180 --> 01:22:30.340]   Puts me at ease.
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:33.220]   You know, no dirt, pastel rug, wall-to-wall carpet,
[01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:35.180]   a little coffee, and just sitting and chatting
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.500]   and it's comfortable, and I made it through.
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.740]   It was the end of the day.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:40.500]   I come out, by now I'm cruising along,
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:41.740]   the seat is completely broken.
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.020]   It's back on the back seat.
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:45.500]   I'm holding myself up with the wheel,
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.140]   exercising my stomach muscles, you know?
[01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:50.580]   And I think, this is fantastic.
[01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:51.420]   I willed it.
[01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:53.780]   I wanted an agent, and I willed it.
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.300]   Isn't it incredible, and you can will something,
[01:22:55.300 --> 01:22:56.780]   you suddenly will it, and you don't know why
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:22:58.900]   you wanted it in the first place, but here I am.
[01:22:58.900 --> 01:23:00.380]   And I willed it, and I've got an agent.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.140]   I made it on the freeways to all the places,
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.180]   was on time, was able to follow a map,
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:06.180]   was able to take responsibility for myself,
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.580]   and I got an agent.
[01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.500]   And you can imagine how many people want an agent.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:10.740]   That's all I heard.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:12.580]   When I went down to Long Beach after the film
[01:23:12.580 --> 01:23:14.940]   to visit the Cambodian refugees that were in the film,
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:17.340]   they said, agent, you've come out to get an agent?
[01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:18.500]   Can you get us an agent?
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:19.340]   How about an agent?
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:20.700]   Do you have any ideas about agents, agent?
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.380]   For us, an agent, an agent, agent, agent, agent?
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:24.660]   And I thought, well, I'd love to get them on,
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:26.900]   but I couldn't visualize what they would be in.
[01:23:26.900 --> 01:23:28.460]   I felt, how would they ever get work?
[01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:31.180]   And then I remembered Norman Lira did that sitcom,
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:34.580]   aka Pablo, and put all the Mexicans to work.
[01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:37.780]   So I suddenly had this very perverse image
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.980]   of this new Cambodian sitcom called,
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.540]   (audience laughing)
[01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:45.740]   called aka Paul Pot.
[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:47.460]   (audience laughing)
[01:23:47.460 --> 01:23:49.660]   Where I had gotten this idea of one was that two years ago,
[01:23:49.660 --> 01:23:52.100]   I had seen a film at the Margaret Mead Festival
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.940]   in which they were taking a very poignant,
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:56.500]   beautiful documentary of the Laotians being relocated
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.540]   after the CIA fucked up Laos.
[01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:01.540]   They had all these Mao tribes that their families
[01:24:01.540 --> 01:24:02.540]   were completely busted up,
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:04.900]   and they were living in refugee camps in Thailand,
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:07.820]   and they were being transported to Washington State
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:11.900]   to condominiums, condos with no furniture, right?
[01:24:11.900 --> 01:24:14.580]   And they arrived there completely displaced from Thailand,
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:17.220]   and there were wall-to-wall shag rugs in there
[01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:19.020]   with the shag as long as my fingers.
[01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:20.220]   And the first thing they do is,
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:21.980]   I guess they think it's some sort of growth,
[01:24:21.980 --> 01:24:23.940]   and they wash it down with a hose,
[01:24:23.940 --> 01:24:26.380]   and they put all the water into the heating vent.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.180]   They think that that is a drain for the water, right?
[01:24:29.180 --> 01:24:31.580]   And then they take chicken breasts
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:32.660]   and stick them in the toaster,
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.100]   thinking that this will cook them.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.740]   And then they go to the supermarket to buy soap.
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:39.580]   And instead of bars of soap, they mistake the soap,
[01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:42.980]   they buy blocks of Velveeta cheese,
[01:24:42.980 --> 01:24:43.980]   thinking it is soap.
[01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:46.620]   So I see the opening shot of AKA Paul Pot.
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:48.500]   It's a Cambodian seeing me in the shower
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.060]   with a bar of Velveeta cheese.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:53.580]   It's breaking up, and hot water is melting it,
[01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.540]   and it's going yellow down the drain.
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:57.740]   Then I'm cruising along, I'm thinking,
[01:24:57.740 --> 01:24:59.140]   my God, I'm out here.
[01:24:59.140 --> 01:25:00.100]   This is fantastic.
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:01.260]   Renee and I could move out.
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:03.340]   We'd get a house that was perfect right, white angles,
[01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:04.460]   and we'd all be together,
[01:25:04.460 --> 01:25:07.260]   and I would be able to do a little Knott's Landing,
[01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:08.740]   do a little Hill Street Blues,
[01:25:08.740 --> 01:25:10.060]   do a little St. Elsewhere,
[01:25:10.060 --> 01:25:11.860]   come home at night exhausted from working hard
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:13.580]   at honest work, and not have to drink
[01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.620]   in order to go to sleep, and eat sprouts and jog,
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:16.700]   and the kids would come along,
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:18.140]   and they would grow up, and they would be fine,
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:19.180]   and we would have enough money
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:20.340]   to send them to a decent school,
[01:25:20.340 --> 01:25:21.260]   and then they would grow up,
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:22.380]   and we'd be with them on the weekends,
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:23.620]   and Renee and I would grow old,
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.900]   and we'd grow old together, and we'd grow old,
[01:25:24.900 --> 01:25:26.220]   and we'd make it through.
[01:25:26.220 --> 01:25:29.980]   And then all of a sudden, the traffic would slow down,
[01:25:29.980 --> 01:25:32.660]   and I'd get into this incredible gridlock situation
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.020]   on the freeway, and I'd be seeing now visions
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:37.780]   of MX missiles flying over pine trees,
[01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.260]   and I'd think, I've got to get back.
[01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:41.060]   I've got to get back to stop the war
[01:25:41.060 --> 01:25:42.180]   between Russia and America.
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.620]   I've got to get back and get my sweaters out
[01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:45.540]   to the Cambodian refugees in Far Rockaway.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.700]   I mean, isn't life, more people are suffering.
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.300]   Isn't it about helping the suffering?
[01:25:49.300 --> 01:25:50.220]   I mean, I'm well off.
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:51.820]   Isn't it about easing people's pain?
[01:25:51.820 --> 01:25:53.340]   Isn't life about service?
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:55.060]   And Jean Donovan flashes back to mind,
[01:25:55.060 --> 01:25:55.900]   and she's haunting me,
[01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.460]   and Jean Donovan's in the car with me.
[01:25:57.460 --> 01:25:59.020]   And see, a cobblestone is speaking to me,
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:00.780]   and I hear her talking to a psychiatrist saying,
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:02.820]   "I hope you can find something wrong with me,
[01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:03.900]   "because if there isn't,
[01:26:03.900 --> 01:26:05.540]   "then there's something wrong with the world,
[01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.580]   "and that would be worse, because that would be incurable."
[01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:11.220]   And I'm thinking about seeing Jean Donovan in Ethiopia,
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:13.860]   in Ethiopia, in Ethiopia, in Ethiopia, in the car.
[01:26:13.860 --> 01:26:15.260]   Gridlock breaks up in the car,
[01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.700]   pulls away, and I'm cruising along,
[01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:18.940]   and it's fantastic to be out in L.A. again.
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:20.660]   And the long dead voice of Alan Watts
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:22.820]   is floating out from his Sausalito houseboat going,
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:25.860]   "Relax, Spalding.
[01:26:25.860 --> 01:26:27.540]   "Enjoy.
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.180]   "You're in California now.
[01:26:29.180 --> 01:26:31.780]   "Let go of all that extra guilt.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:32.780]   "Enjoy.
[01:26:32.780 --> 01:26:34.260]   "Life's a party.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:36.620]   "So you came in at the end of it.
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:39.340]   (audience laughs)
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:41.340]   "Enjoy it anyway."
[01:26:41.340 --> 01:26:43.500]   And I went home completely exhausted,
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.500]   got out some tequila, took a couple of shots,
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.340]   and went to bed, slept, and dreamt.
[01:26:49.340 --> 01:26:52.500]   Dreamt that I was in a cabin
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:54.020]   taking care of a 10-year-old boy.
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:57.460]   I was the babysitter in the woods, big fireplace.
[01:26:57.460 --> 01:26:59.100]   Roaring fire in the fireplace,
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:01.500]   and he would run into the fire
[01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:03.380]   and get partially consumed by the flames.
[01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:05.020]   It was a game he was playing with me.
[01:27:05.020 --> 01:27:06.580]   And then he would run out again.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.260]   And I was a little nervous about this game.
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.580]   I was keeping an eye on him.
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.740]   And he ran back in, and I saw that this time
[01:27:11.740 --> 01:27:14.940]   that his body, his body was completely in flames.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:17.100]   In fact, his legs were the shape of flames.
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:17.940]   There were no legs.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:18.940]   It was flame legs.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.060]   And I really went into a panic,
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:22.740]   and I got this fire poker, and I tried to get him out,
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.660]   but there was no substance, only flames.
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:27.500]   And the flames burned down and left a pile of gray ash
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.340]   on the hearth.
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:31.460]   And I looked at the corner of the cabin,
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.180]   and there was a straw effigy, a straw boy,
[01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:35.940]   an effigy of this boy.
[01:27:35.940 --> 01:27:37.460]   And I went over, and I took the gray ash,
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:41.060]   and I blew it into the ribs of the straw effigy,
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:42.460]   and it came alive.
[01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:45.300]   And it turned to me, and it had a great all-knowing,
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:48.100]   knowledgeable, joyous smile from ear to ear in its face.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:49.700]   And it just shook its head like this.
[01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.060]   The straw boy shook its head.
[01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.620]   And I realized that the straw boy
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:54.900]   had decided to be consumed by the flames,
[01:27:54.900 --> 01:27:57.180]   had chosen not to come back.
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.740]   And the spirit of the straw boy went out,
[01:27:58.740 --> 01:28:00.180]   and I was left holding this effigy,
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.740]   this empty, spiritless straw boy in my arms.
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.460]   And I thought, how am I ever going to tell
[01:28:04.460 --> 01:28:05.780]   the mother this story?
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:08.500]   She'll never believe me of what happened to her son.
[01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:09.740]   And I found that I was wandering
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:10.900]   through the streets of Hollywood
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.540]   looking for a witness to tell the story to,
[01:28:12.540 --> 01:28:15.260]   and I came upon Ron Vorder, an active friend of mine.
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.340]   And I told him the story, and he said,
[01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:19.220]   "Spalding, you really should have called the police immediately.
[01:28:19.220 --> 01:28:20.980]   You need witnesses for this.
[01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.740]   No one will ever believe you, and you can't reenact
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:24.180]   such a thing for the police."
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:27.100]   And I went on further, and I came upon Elizabeth LeCompte,
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.900]   the theater director, and the straw boy's mother
[01:28:28.900 --> 01:28:30.540]   sitting by a swimming pool here in Hollywood
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.580]   drinking tall lemonades.
[01:28:32.580 --> 01:28:36.060]   And I began to try to tell them the story of the straw boy.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.220]   And I found that I was unable to tell it.
[01:28:38.220 --> 01:28:40.500]   And instead, in a very loud, dramatic voice,
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:42.980]   instead I began telling them that I was upset
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:45.900]   because I had just been in a new Peckinpah movie
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:47.420]   of the seagull.
[01:28:47.420 --> 01:28:48.900]   (audience laughing)
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:51.580]   Yeah, Peckinpah made a film in this dream
[01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:55.220]   of Chekhov's The Seagull, and I played Kostya.
[01:28:55.220 --> 01:28:57.300]   I played Konstantin Gorilovich, the guy, the writer,
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.860]   that shoots himself in the head at the end of the film.
[01:28:59.860 --> 01:29:01.860]   And what I was upset about, I was telling them,
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.780]   is that I'd seen the film, and it was fine.
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.980]   Actually, it was good, and I liked myself in it.
[01:29:05.980 --> 01:29:10.100]   But I was upset because I had no memory of making the film.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:11.900]   And all the time I was telling this,
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:12.740]   all the time I was telling it,
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:15.140]   I knew it was a cover for the straw boy story,
[01:29:15.140 --> 01:29:18.580]   which for some reason I felt unable to tell.
[01:29:18.580 --> 01:29:23.340]   Thank you.
[01:29:23.340 --> 01:29:27.460]   (audience applauding)
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.460]   - One quick announcement.
[01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.020]   First, thank you very much for coming
[01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:50.820]   and supporting me here, and thank you.
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:53.780]   Tomorrow doesn't have an AFR to play it for this time,
[01:29:53.780 --> 01:29:54.780]   two to three.
[01:29:54.780 --> 01:29:57.100]   And then part one is my next to last show.
[01:29:57.100 --> 01:30:02.180]   There is also a videotape, a two videotape with AFI
[01:30:02.180 --> 01:30:05.180]   and memory of the 25th, one of which is called
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.660]   Spalding's Napa Delle.
[01:30:06.660 --> 01:30:08.380]   It's a shot-off, you went up to the car place
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:11.180]   and you had a moto, and that has Masha Eftron
[01:30:11.180 --> 01:30:14.620]   and Mary Wan off in it, and Madeline Pizzo and myself,
[01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.740]   and the other one is called Gray Areas,
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.020]   which is a video, that's our video of my tour,
[01:30:19.020 --> 01:30:21.140]   imagery of the audience in the arena,
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:24.780]   and our last shot of every TV show on television.
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:26.020]   Thank you for coming.
[01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:29.180]   (audience applauding)
