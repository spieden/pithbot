[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.740]   Thank you.
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:44.700]   Roll over and turn off the radio deciding to do without the news this morning.
[00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.740]   As my eye scans out the bedroom window across the historic cemetery and stops on the old whalers church.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:57.480]   This old church built in 1844 used to have a 168-foot high steeple.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:03.000]   That the whalers who would be out to see two, three years at a time would guide themselves in round Montauk Point,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.040]   looking at this steeple.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:12.000]   Then the 1938 hurricane blew it down and left this church looking like one of the most unusual examples of what I could only describe as
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.400]   colonial Egyptian revival.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.560]   I mean it looks like a white clapboard
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.840]   Egyptian tomb. It looks like George Washington and King Tut could be buried side-by-side there.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.320]   As my eye scans back now across the cemetery
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.100]   and I roll over and look down at Theo, my sleeping infant nine-month-old son beside me, and I think how?
[00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.820]   How did I come to be in this place?
[00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.280]   Never in my wildest imagination soothsay of fantasy dreams did I ever think at age 54,
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.060]   56 that I would re-enact my family constrict.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:57.280]   And Marissa, Kathy, two adults, Kathy and myself, Marissa, her daughter,
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.880]   Forrest, our son, and now a little infant Theo beside me. I mean Kathy always said that she knew in high school
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.360]   she was going to have three children. What did I know in high school? Really, nothing. What do I know now? Nothing.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.680]   I didn't know I wanted to be with Kathy until I was with her.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.320]   I didn't know I wanted a child until I held my son in my arms.
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.080]   I thought I wanted to end up by the sea, the ocean, and never knew which one being a Gemini.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.640]   I was always bouncing back and forth between East Coast and West Coast, Atlantic and Pacific. And then on my 54th birthday
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.320]   Kathy took me out as a surprise to Sag Harbor to the American Hotel. She'd never been out there.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.600]   She wanted to see the town. And this old colonial hotel, and we go out and afterwards dinner
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.640]   we're walking around the streets and we see this house is for sale. And we go into the yard kind of exploring and
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.760]   we try the front door. And it was unlocked, so we just went in. It wasn't breaking and entering really. It was just entering.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.400]   Looking around at this house and exploring it
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.640]   we started to have fantasies about what it would be like to raise a family out in a small village like that.
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.800]   And knowing really it was the fantasies, I mean we couldn't imagine me. I mean leaving New York City after 30 years or
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.760]   I'd be starting Bloody Marys at noon out there in Sag Harbor. Could Kathy work out of her home?
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.000]   You know, could she do her talent agency out of the home and leave New York?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.720]   What were the schools like? We didn't know any of it.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.140]   But we fantasized. And we did, when we got back, we took the real estate number off the sign and called the real estate agent.
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.560]   Now real estate agents aren't called real estate agents for no reason. They really know how to reel you in.
[00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.320]   And this
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   agent happened to me named Jan Hooks.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:39.560]   And she just happened to work for Harpoon Realty, you see.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.640]   So we were hooked and harpooned.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.120]   And we went out to take a look. And we liked it. Of course we had to pretend we hadn't seen the inside, you see.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.800]   And it suited us just fine, both of us, because it was an 1890s house.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.640]   But it looked 1890s inside as well as out. Many of those houses out there look old outside.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.040]   But look like dentist waiting rooms inside. You know, too much sheetrock and indented ceiling lights.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:08.080]   So we liked it. Really, we liked those wide pine board floors. You could see the cellar light shining up through the cracks.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.000]   We liked the way the rooms were all angles, the doorways. In fact, my accountant/financial advisor
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:21.160]   was so upset when he saw the house that he made us sign a disclaimer that we wouldn't hold him responsible if I went through
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.780]   with buying it. And I did. We both went through. I can't believe it.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.000]   We bought that house and moved out. And as soon as I moved out there,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.080]   I had this fantasy, or rather it had me, I would have to say. I wasn't aware of making it up.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:42.320]   But as soon as I got out to this house, I would come down with a vile case of hepatitis, of all things, and be incapacitated.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.720]   Not from the shellfish out there, no. But when I was leaving New York after 32 years, or 30 years of relatively good health,
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.640]   I go into the little deli across from my loft. Kathy calls it the dirty deli, a dute fingers deli.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.960]   She won't go in it. But I go in that particular morning, and I'm escaping from New York last, and I have the salad bar.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.480]   And the guy making the salad that morning just happened to have a little bit of poop under his fingernails.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:12.360]   So I get out there, and I see myself with this fever laying there in this cherrywood sleigh bed.
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.040]   And my stepdaughter Marissa, of all people, is nursing me back with huge bowls of chicken soup, you see,
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:21.680]   which is spilling over the edges and going down between the whiteboard plank floors into the living room.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.280]   And then one feverish night, when everyone in the family is asleep, I stagger out in a wild rainstorm,
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.960]   headed across the historic cemetery, not for the Wailing Church, but not for the Jesus and the Twelve Disciples,
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.280]   but for the 12-step program. And going across the cemetery in this wild wind and rain,
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.080]   when no one's allowed to be buried anymore, I fall down and perish there, and the family finds me.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.760]   He gives me a secret burial, wraps me in garbage bags, and gives me a secret burial.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:57.160]   They are beside Phoebe Niles, whose tombstone reads, "Phoebe Niles, aged 17 years, 8 months, 15 days, died October 23, 1804.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.360]   Behold and see as you pass by, as I am now, so once, as you are now, so once was I.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:12.600]   As I am now, so you must be. Prepare for death, and follow me."
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:16.600]   Where did this silly fantasy come from?
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:22.240]   Instead of death and hepatitis, we moved into the house.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.240]   New life came. Cathy got pregnant. How did this happen?
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:43.240]   "I don't think I want this child. I'm happy with the new family configuration we have in our new home," I told my therapist.
[00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:49.520]   And she said, "You sound very clear now. You must go to Cathy now and tell her exactly what you've told me."
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:58.680]   So I raced to Cathy before I forgot what I told Martha, and said, "I don't think I want this child. I'm happy with our family configuration now and our new home."
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:07.800]   And Cathy goes, "Very well. If you feel you don't want any more children, and you're so sure of that, well, I am not going to use abortion as birth control, and I'm not going to have two operations.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:15.000]   If I have to get an abortion, I am not also going to have my troops tied. You've got to get a vasectomy."
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I said I would look into it. And I did. And I came back with an alternative plan.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   If we have an amnio and find out that it is not indeed a girl and not a boy, we'll go through with it.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   "But no, no, no, not another boy. My father had three. I saw what we did to him. I don't want to be taken down."
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Cathy goes, "I'm not playing with life. No way. Not that. You've got to make up your mind on this."
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So I go back into therapy now. It's a very intense session. And I have a breakthrough or breakdown, really. I just start to weep and cry.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And say, "Martha, I am really too old to opt for termination of this fetus, to opt for death over life. I'm going to go through with it no matter what it means."
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   She said, "You sound clear now, Spalding. I want you to remember this clarity. So in times to come when the going gets rough, you'll remember this day and how you spoke to me."
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   So I go down to meet Cathy with couple therapy. God, we overload therapy in this situation. We're going to couples as well as singles.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   And Cathy is ready to do my bidding, you know, provided I help her give away the clothing that she's saved from the other two children for the third one she always had planned for, you see.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   And I totally surprised her by saying that I had this change of mind. And it was a great celebration. We celebrated with our therapist. And everyone was very positive, I have to say.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   All our friends were positive in backing us and this child. I think the only kind of non-positive, not supportive voice I ran into was on the beaches of Martha's Vineyard, of all things.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   We were down there. I didn't take it personally because I hardly knew the man, but I was down there performing my monologue as a slippery slope at the Vineyard Playhouse.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And this man came up to me on the beach and said, "You look familiar." I said, "Well, I am."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   "No, no, no," he said. "Don't you live next door to me in Providence, Rhode Island?" "No, no, no. I'm an actor and I do small roles and people see me sometimes and they think I'm their neighbor. They can't play." "No, no, you're an actor."
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   "Oh, I get it. Yeah, you did that slippery slope program at the Vineyard Playhouse. The one where you're with your girlfriend for a long time, you get married and then you make your next door neighbor pregnant and you have a nervous break."
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   "I remember it, please. Don't go through it here, please, with me again. I know it by heart."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   "What I was going to say is that you were the one that had the nervous breakdown. It seems the two women should have had at least one nervous breakdown. Tell me, is that the woman that had the baby over there? Are you with her?"
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I said, "Yes, that's her." "And she's pregnant again?" "Yes, she is." "Oh, you really go in for total immersion, don't you?"
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Then he turns to me and says, "Do I look familiar?" I said, "Not really, I can't place you." He introduces himself as, "Turn out it's Peter Kramer who wrote Listening to Prozac, you see."
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Now, Kathy's sister is visiting from Stowe, Vermont and she thinks he's Martin Short and is waving, "Hi, I just loved you and father of the bride."
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   We're sure it's going to be a girl. Kathy's sure we're going to name it Eliza Ann Gray. She's sure because there's no morning sickness. She's carrying it higher as she did with her daughter, Marissa.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Street people stop and touch her and bless her and say, "It's a girl." Her grandfather does the same and she's craving peanut butter just as she did with her daughter, Marissa.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Now, we are called in for genetic counseling. I wasn't ready for this, Kathy, because she was 35 and I because I'm ready for genetic counseling, I guess.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   I didn't go through it with my first child because he, well, I was married at the time, so it was a very difficult time and I just wasn't available for the genetic counseling.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Now, we're going in. I am amazed, first of all, by how many questions about psychopathology they're asking. I had never really paid attention to my family.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I think I was so myopic from my mother's madness and suicide that I didn't think about the other relatives, you see.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   And I said, "Well, come to think of it, my mother's mother, my grandmother, Horton, clearly had Tourette's."
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   But we never talked about it because she was a Christian scientist, you see, and she was in denial.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   But she had this little sucking of air, like, "We'll all be safe in heaven one day, dear."
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   And her aunt, her sister, my Aunt Belle, was a spinster that lived up in Scituate, Rhode Island, and she was a dowser for a living. That's how she made a living.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   She could take an apple branch and break it off and walk around the field, and when there was surface water, that branch would go right down.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And they'd dig a well there, and they paid her for this. Only she would get moonstruck occasionally during full moons and a bit wild and wide-eyed.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And one full moon, she filled her pants pockets with rocks and walked in the air against the bay, but didn't sink because her bloom was filled up with air and she floated.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Kathy says, "Come to think of it, I have an uncle in San Antonio, Texas that can't go out of the house because soda machines give him orders."
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   I say, "Nothing good nor bad, but thinking makes it so. Onward and upward."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   January 16th at 3 a.m., the contractions begin. We were told it was going to be a wild snowstorm, but it was rain instead.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   It was a wild, wild Soweaster coming in, and the trees were twisting. It looked like a Currier Ives Disney Fantasia as we drove racing nervously to the hospital.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   We get to the hospital and things are kind of weird, as they were when we first went in in July for the amnio.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   The hospital then was in a state of emergency. Kathy and I had been walking on the beach then in July, and it was early in the morning, and a lone man was looking out at the ocean, crying, weeping.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   We thought someone had drowned. And he turns to us and says, "We can never fly safely again. Someone has just blown up TWA Flight 800 to Paris."
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And we get to the hospital and it's a state of emergency, expecting survivors or bodies to be brought in.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   And now in this wild storm, the hospital is strange again, because the head nurse explains to us there had been a stillborn incident that night, and no one understood how it could have happened.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   And also, they're a little weeded out by the fact that Kathy has brought her daughter, Marissa. And Marissa is 10 years old, and they feel that that's not appropriate, that she was going to freak out if she sees a child being born.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Kathy said, "It's fine. It's perfectly fine." I never expected to be having a child in Southampton, Long Island. I never expected to have children.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   I mean, I thought if I ever was going to have children, it would be in a teepee in Northern California. You know, basically my life has been what I've been doing while preparing to move to Northern California.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But now it's getting kind of really real. And we're all in there, and Kathy's assuring the nurses it's going to be a quick delivery, because the other two children came very quickly.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Well, in my opinion, it's not. We're well into the next day. The storm is still raging.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Eleven hours into this thing, Kathy can only find one comfortable position. She's on all fours like a wild animal.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   The nurses are rolling their eyes and their head. Marissa's dozing in the corner. I'm trying to get the hermetically sealed window open, knowing I'm not in Northern California.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   And it begins to come, and I just have time to get the scrubs on and roll Kathy over. I've got one knee back. The nurse has the other knee back.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And I look down, and oh my God. It looked like she'd given birth to a dead beaver.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   What is that blue hairy football trying to push out, and how is it going to fit through that pow?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And I yell, "Look at the balls on that girl."
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   And Marissa's flashing away with her little camera, and she drops it and goes, "All right. Now I get my own room."
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And I think, "Death by boydom. They will take me down."
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Whenever I'm at home, I don't have any hi-fi system. I just carry this little radio around this portable, you know, listening.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Sometimes I'll turn up something right here. I remember my friend Ken was out, and we heard, "Well, that was over. William Burroughs.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   "81 years of injury in William Burroughs in Los Angeles. Oh, William Burroughs." I said, "Oh my God. Turn it up, Ken. William Burroughs has died. Oh my God. I can't believe it."
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   "Oh, he turned it up?" "Nope. He's having an art opening in Los Angeles at 81."
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   I said, "Will you look at that? My father died at 81. Look at William Burroughs. My God, he had sex with over 300 Arab boys, shot his wife dead in the head, was addicted to heroin for most of his adult life.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   He's having an art opening at 81. My father died at 81." And Ken goes, "Yeah, but William Burroughs didn't have three sons."
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And I looked down at him. Another glorious accident. Theo. T-H-E-O. We snatched it out of the air, just in case it was a boy.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Theo. Short for nothing. Short for the study of God. Theo. Spalding cray. And I kiss Kathy and cry and reach over and cut the umbilical cord and the crimson blood sprays.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And I look down at his face and coming back at me is the big why. Why this? Why something and not nothing? And I totally empathize with this child and I also know that he's not picking it up from me.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   He's not been in the world long enough to be marrying me. He's brought this in with him. And I think, "Oh, little one, you may have spent the best days of your life already in there."
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   It was the children that got me out of New York City, that drove me out. It was the double chaos factor. I had lived in New York City with two women before I met Kathy and didn't have children with either of them.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   And they were always kind of, it was sanctuary, coming back to the apartment or the loft and them nurturing me from the chaos of the city and how I loved to go out into that madness and then come back.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   But once I had children, I was going from madness to madness. There was no retreat. I first came to New York City to visit on September 29, 1959, inspired by the writings of Thomas Wolfe, those giant novels about the city.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   And I went up to the Riverside Cathedral bell tower and looked out over the city and made a pledge, a promise that I would move there and become a writer.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   And I did move there, but I never wrote about the city because I couldn't imagine it. I couldn't get, I mean, that's what finally attracted me to it, was that it was so chaotic that it should not have existed. It was like a miracle.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   It was like functional dysfunction or dysfunctional function. It was like my mom, only it was surviving. And that fascinated me. And I began to think it was only because it was going 24 hours.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   If it was ever to take a five-minute break, it might never start up again. In fact, it reminded me of a poster my mom put over our bed. It was a picture of a bumblebee when we were kids.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   And the big letter said, "The bumblebee cannot fly. And underneath, according to all aerodynamic laws, the relationship of the bee's wings to the body's sides will make it impossible to fly. But ignoring this, it flies anyway."
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   That was New York City for me. And Forrest, my son Forrest, was born there, so he was a city kid. And I tried to wean him of the city by taking him when he was quite young, just a little over two.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   He wasn't quite two years old yet, I think, to Ethlin Institute in Big Sur, California. Some people think paradise on earth. He wouldn't let me put him down on the grass. He ran from flowers.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   When we got up to Berkeley, he got up to Berkeley, got on the pavement, he streaked down the sidewalk with a little flashlight going along Telegraph Avenue, shining the light in the homeless eyes. And at last, he'd come home.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   So I go back to New York City with him to re-experience it through his eyes. And I remember we went back to see the David Copperfield magic act on Broadway, and we were going up by subway. I always travel by subway in New York.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   And we were walking up West Broadway to go to the subway, and we come upon this guy with a huge, huge telescope. And I don't even know how he got it there on the corner of Spring Street and West Broadway.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   And for two dollars, you could look through it and see Saturn with its rings. We did it! Forrest saw Saturn. I saw Saturn. The first time I've seen Saturn. There, on the corner of West Broadway and Spring Street.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   A little further up, an old man in a pinstripe suit playing a Casio, taking a request from passers-by. Forrest requested hot cross buns. And he played it.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   In the subway now, the woman comes through. Ah, help! My daughter burned 60% of her body in a hotel fire. Shortly after that, I got the gangrene, lost three toes. See, the toes are missing. And you look down, and you see indeed, the shoe has been cut away and the toes aren't there.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   You figure it's an act, but it's a good act and deserves some money, and you give her some money. Forrest, give her some money. In now come the breakdancers and the guys with ghetto blasters, they put it down four feet from us, and they began to, whoa, they began to breakdance and moonwalk.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   They're doing the rock and roll. They're swinging around the subway poles, swinging off the straps. Forrest is a god. We get to the David Copperfield show. It's all right.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And I roll over and see Theo sleeping, and I think I was told I would be waking up every four hours. No sleep deprivation. He's sleeping right through. But I'm waking up every four hours, listening to his breathing. He seems so barely in the world.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   He wakes up now and pops up, and Kathy is beside him waking up. He's looking out and pulling himself up on the back of the bed to look out the north window down into the village of Sag Harbor, and he's letting out with these little ooh and little cackles. He looks like a little toothless old Italian winemaker. He looks so ancient.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   He looks like a little American winemaker on the Italian Swiss colony bottles. And Kathy is up beside him saying, "Where's the light, Theo? Where's the light?" And now I leap up because I want to go take my shower and get my yoga done before the other children get up.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   Marissa and Forrest, I don't know where they are. The house is kind of big for them, and so they're sleeping in various places. They haven't settled down yet, and they have a sense it's haunted. Marissa claims she hears a tea party going on downstairs at 3 in the morning.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Forrest says to the tag sale George Washington, the Gilbert Stewart unfinished George Washington we have over the fireplace, his eyes are following him. And last week, one winked at him.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So they might be sleeping huddled together in Kathy's office or up in the attic. She will take care of rounding them up. I go in to take the quick shower and look down into the tub, and it's filled with plastic action figures.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Oh my God, it reminds me of when I was having the affair with Kathy. I would go to her loft and use her bathroom and look down, and her daughter Marissa was probably three or four then, tub filled with broken Barbie dolls, headless Barbie dolls, little washing machines, plastic combs.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   I thought, that's one good reason for not having children. And now I look down, and it's as strange to me as the Volvo station wagon I'm driving with three bikes on the back, stuff from floor to ceiling.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   Three children in the back, two adults driving, one refereeing, and the other navigating. And I look down now at this tub filled with Ninja Turtles, Buzz Lightyear, Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, R2D2, Spiderman, the Jurassic Rage Rig, long neck, sharp tooth.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   All the Power Rangers, Kimberly, Bobby, Tommy, and Adam, all floating up around my ankles like a plastic Busby Berkeley cartoon water ballet.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Now down in the living room at last alone, I do my first yoga stretches. And I love this silence, and I love this room as I look around at the George Washington over the mantelpiece.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   And then the other George Washington over the couch, a more complicated one, George on his death bed. He's sitting up, rather startled, as if to say, "What? After Valley Forge, dying of a cold?"
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   There's a woman weeping there beside him, "I take it to be Martha." There's two very professional looking men speculating like a combination of lawyers and doctors, "What, should we bleed him again?"
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   And in the distance, some indifferent slaves looking actually like white minstrels dressed as blacks. And now the far end of the room is a glass door. Someone had put French doors in somewhere in the history of the house, so the whole door, the whole side of that room is light.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And turning now as I stretch, I look out the window by the fireplace past the wingback chair and see in the distance the steeple, the other steeple. There are so many churches, we can see at least four from our house. There's probably as many churches as bars.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And this one is the Catholic church steeple, not blown down, with a gold cross on top, and now the rose light is hitting that as the sun comes up. And I pull back, my eye pulls back to trees starting to turn now, yellowing along the street.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   And I think, trees. Ah, trees. How did I live so long without them? Thirty years in New York City, never had a view of a tree out my window. When I think of where I grew up in Barrington, Rhode Island, and that road I grew up on, Rumstick Road, which was a great in the summer, a great green archway of shade and tunnel of shade in summer.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And then in the winter, the trees acted like dark black vocal chords to the winter wind howling as we ran between our house and the neighbors. And then it happened. My brother Rocky, who loved these trees and wanted to be a tree surgeon, came to me with headlines from the Providence Journal.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   It said, "Greatest ecological disaster to hit North America." Ninety-five percent of the trees wiped out by Dutch elm disease, and they started cutting them down, and I didn't recognize that town. It looked like a cowboy town in the southwest.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   Now Rocky got so upset about this, I don't know if it was puberty or the trees being cut down, but he suddenly no longer wanted to be a tree surgeon, he wanted to be a lumberjack in Maine.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   And he wanted to quit school and run away to Maine. My father wouldn't hear of it, but he'd run away anyway. And the way he'd run away, he wouldn't go out the front door. He would climb out his bedroom window, go along the gutter, shimmy down a pine tree, hitchhike to Maine.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Get as far as the Rhode Island, Massachusetts border, the state police would pick him up, take him in, call my father at one, two in the morning, up he'd go, bring him back. And so it went until he figured out a way to get thrown out of high school.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Rocky poured hydrochloric acid in the goldfish tank in biology class, and he threw him out. And he started living in our backyard, like a lumberjack in this L.L. Beam, red and black plaid shirt, in a little cabin he built from stolen wood from houses being built in the area.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Making a Mazo instant chocolate pudding with my mother's little egg beater. Now my father, never a man for corporal punishment. I have to give him credit, he never struck any of his sons.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   My father was a creative man, I think that he felt that living and dying in this world was punishment enough.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   He went to the town of Barrington and had them bring all of the elm trees they chopped down from Rumstick Road and pile them in this huge pile in our yard.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And gave my brother Rocky a hand saw and said, "You want to be a lumberjack? Start cutting. We'll have firewood for a lifetime."
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   And so he was out there cutting and cutting and cutting and cutting. And I have to give my father credit. Because I understand now, being a father, how much discipline it takes not to strike your son, and I have to admit.
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I did it once, early on with Forrest, I have to confess. He was just a little over two I think. And we took him, Kathy and I, to a vacation in Western Ireland. And we had a wonderful time because the sun came out one day.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   It was in July, what a glorious day it was. We were on the beach, and it was like going back to Forrest's age when I was in Seconnet, Rhode Island in 1943, seeing it through his eyes.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Then in Seconnet it was pristine like Ireland and green with dairy cows grazing. I hadn't even heard the word cancer yet.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And there too, it was like this with these cows, no houses around, I was in the ocean swimming, Kathy was jogging on the beach, Forrest was playing naked in a tidal pool.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And I thought I was, at that moment, one of the happiest I'd ever been. And I came out and there was this perfect bonding moment in which I took Forrest in my arms and began to spin him around in that tidal pool.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   And as I was spinning him around I looked down at my thighs and saw these unbelievable purple, yellow, and green flowering bruises.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   And immediately I reached back into my Hara chamber of memories and pulled up an Ethson workshop I had done at Big Sur in Autobiographic Storytelling where a woman told a story about losing her leg to cancer.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   And she said I first knew something was wrong when I saw those awful purple bruises. And I just collapsed with Forrest in my arms and Kathy chocked over going, "What is wrong?" I said, "I've got the leg cancer."
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   She goes, "You still can't take a vacation? You're not going to mess this one up." She said, "We're going to a doctor immediately so we'll get this cleared up."
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   So we go to Galway to a doctor and I have to tell you I like this man right away. I walk in and he goes, "Alright, you don't know me and I don't know you so there's no sense in trusting each other right off."
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   "So you think you have the leg cancer then?" "Well they have to be doing some tests on the platelet and the clotting factor. The blood will have to go to a laboratory so that gives about four days before you know so go have a party, have a ball."
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   He is right. My God, he took the fear of death, took it all right off me, took it to the laboratory. I was able to relax for four wonderful days. We're canoeing outside Galway.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   But as that fourth day came towards six o'clock, oh it's like the Rumpelstiltskin complex. I'm going, "Oh, oh, oh, oh, Kathy, you give him a call. Find out what's up. I'm going down to get a drink in the bar."
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   She goes, "They're not going to tell me anything over the phone. You have to call them directly." "Oh, it's Ireland. They might do it here in Ireland."
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   So I go down and I got a Guinness and a Jameson's neat and I come back up and she goes, "He says you're going to have to call him directly."
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   I said, "Oh no. Oh God, let me sit down. Shake his up, shake his up, shake his up."
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   She goes, "Just kidding. I thought I'd give you a taste of your own medicine. But he does want to speak to you."
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   So I call him. He says, "Good news, then, on the blood. I want to ask you a question, then. You had a wee one, then, a lad you brought in. Is he even hitting on you in any way, then?"
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   Whoa. Oh my God, I'm glad you asked that question. I forgot. I've been reading that T. W. Winnicott, the British child therapist, who says that two-year-olds have an omnipotent fantasy that they can devour their parents.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   They can destroy them. They're totally potent. And in order to diffuse this fantasy, they have to attack constantly to see if it's true.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   And I was letting Forrest exercise that on me. I was letting him bite my thigh very hard, but didn't notice the bruises until the good weather came, you see?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And I took my pants off to put on my bathing suit.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   So we get back to America, and Forrest has grown just enough now, so his teeth are a little higher, and he goes, "Ow!" and bites into my right testicle, and I just wham!
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   It was a ball jerk reaction.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   He's crying. "Are you all right, honey? Are you all right? Oh, sweetie. Oh my God, why did you... My underwear was bloody. He drew blood. What, was this early Oedipal? What? What? Will we ever know?"
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And speaking of trees, Forrest is down.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   And I'm trying to do my last of my stretches. He's got the Where's Waldo in Hollywood book.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   He brings it over in the middle of my yoga. He wants me to find Waldo amongst 2,000 Ben Hur Extras in Hollywood.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   I say, "Later, later." Kathy's down behind him. She's got the radio on, carrying Theo in her arms. She's got the news on, and, oh, breakfast is beginning.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   She puts Theo in the little high chair, and he gets his melody trained and starts playing with that, gets his Cheerios out. He's happy.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   Oh, Marissa's down. I can't believe it. The kids are raking up on their own. You see, you have to drag them out of bed.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   She's down, and she's boiling water to make her oatmeal. Kathy goes, "Keep that water away from the baby. Don't get that near the baby, please."
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Marissa runs out on the porch to look for the New York Times in search of anything she can find about Spice Girls.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   And I am amazed how much the New York Times is printing about Spice Girls.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   "What do you want for breakfast, Forrest?" Kathy says.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   "Captain Crunch, Mom. And what can I make for lunch?" She goes, "Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, no crusts on the bread, no peanuts in the butter, and no seeds in the jelly."
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   "Marissa, what do you want for lunch? Can I put that cold pizza in?"
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   "No, I saw a fly throw up on it last night," she says.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   "Oh, my God, hurry, hurry. Come spalding. Finish your yoga," Kathy says, "and get out in the basement and get Forrest's jeans. He needs them."
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   I'm finishing up my salute to the sun. I go down into the basement, and suddenly I hear that someone has turned off the news upstairs.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   I assume it's Marissa clumping around, and all of a sudden, "Shut that thing down. It's that damn Spice Girls. I feel like I'm living in a disco, for God's sakes.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   I feel like I'm having a cigarette and coffee for breakfast. Shut it down, shut it down."
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   All of a sudden, there's this huge crash of glass, and Forrest says, "Dad, you know that picture of George Washington on his death bed? He's dead."
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   Marissa just kicked her clog through it. "What?" Kathy says, "Those are my clogs."
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   "I was an accident," Marissa says, "an accident." "You're not supposed to dance with clogs," Kathy says.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   "Quake this glass all over the couch. Get the vacuum cleaner, the baby, the baby, the glass. Marissa, go upstairs."
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   Forrest says, "My jeans are damp, Mom. My jeans are damp. I am not going to be the only one in school with damp jeans."
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   "Go downstairs and put them in the dryer spalding. Hurry, hurry, get the vacuum cleaner. I need help. Marissa, go get your schoolbooks," Kathy says.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   She runs down with her schoolbooks, gets her lunch, puts them in her bag. Kathy grabs her, puts away the vacuum cleaner, and they are gone.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   And I am with the boys. And the house is two people calmer. Now I have to get Forrest dressed very quickly to get him ready for school.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   And that means I'm going to have to go up to the attic with him to help him select his clothes because he won't go up to the attic alone because I let him see the Chucky video.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   So now that means I have to take Theo out of his side chair and go up and follow Forrest up. And I take Theo out, who's squirming, and I take him into my arms.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:36.000]   And at last I feel he's centered, that weight. Oh, the world is doomed to overpopulation, I think. I understand why people keep having babies as they hold him at this moment.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   And crunch across the Cheerios on the floor and start up behind Forrest's attic.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   In the attic, holding Theo, I look out my two favorite windows. The arch window is looking to the north. And now with the trees starting to lose leaves, I can almost see a patch of the bay, really.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   You could say off-season, it is the slight water view. And then going down to the other arch window, I see the cemetery. And turning to see Forrest, oh, he's put on his own shirt.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   Hey, you look beautiful. I almost said beautiful. Cool. Cool is the only adjective Forrest allows in. No, I will not allow awesome into the house until something awesome happens.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   And we are waiting. Downstairs now, Kathy is back from taking Marissa to school. She drove her to school. It's not far. I mean, the kids could walk to school if we only took time to teach them.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   So now Kathy says to Forrest, who do you want to take? Someone has to take Forrest to school. And he always knows. It's different every day.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And he says, Mom, that's fine. That means Kathy is going to go. I'll stay home with Theo. That means Kathy will go to his assembly. The whole school has an assembly in the gym before he begins.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And then they do patriotic songs, songs about wailing, baby beluga, salute the flag. Sag Harbor has more flags in it than I've ever seen. I thought it was a national holiday when I first got there, but I've come to love it. I've really come to love it.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   And those patriotic songs. I mean, did we hear them? Land where our fathers died, land of the pilgrims' pride. Now at home, I'm kind of cleaning up Marissa's oatmeal. She's barely eating it, her instant oatmeal. I'm clearing it off, eating it as I go.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   That's kind of my breakfast. My God, I've put on 20 pounds since I've had children. Crawling under the table in restaurants, I cannot stand to see the food wasted. I don't mind tipping, but I feel bad for the busboys.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   I crawl under to pick up the rice and pasta and French fries, and I don't take it out on trade. I'm just eating too much of the kids' food. I can't stand it. My mom did it. When she had a little plastic stranger in the corner of the sink, we should have to scrape our food in that we didn't eat.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   She'd pick it out and eat it. Think of the starving Koreans, she'd say. Now look, 50 years later, the Koreans are still starving, and we're still getting fat eating for them. Theo is just squirming in my arms. He's a little squirm in my flesh and bone garden. It feels like he's growing right in my arms.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   I suddenly have a paranoid fantasy as I'm holding him. I understand why the American government encourages large families. Once you have one child, you don't even notice what's going on out there.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Conspiracies. They could be building a nuclear power plant in my backyard, and I wouldn't notice. So Kathy comes back. I turn Theo over to her. I'm going to finally get out, take what's left of the paper, have a little coffee.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Kathy takes Theo up to her office upstairs in the library where she's working out of the home three days a week. I just start to get the paper out of what's actually the day before Tuesday, and I hear this knock on the door.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And I go, oh my God, it's one of the workers. They're always coming up to check. There's always something wrong with the house. It's an 1890s house, and I'm allergic to hammers. There's nothing I can do to fix it. The only thing I can do is go out on the road and tell stories about the disrepair of the house.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   And then come back. It's an 1890s house, which means I'm out on the road an awful lot now. So she calls the workers to come up and give her an estimate on it, and I let her do that because, well, we're not married, and she goes under the name Russo.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   And most of these guys are Italian Americans. They're coming up to do the bid, so I figure they're going to come quicker for a goombah than a gray. But whenever they arrive, Kathy is up in her office, and I'm sitting there in my yoga outfit like a dressed down Ozzie Nelson.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   Always on the verge of going to work. And they always say, oh, you must be Mr. Russo. And I've come to say, yeah, it's easier to say it. Yeah, Mr. Russo. So that's my new pseudonym there, Ozzie Russo.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Kathy, you want to come down? There's a guy, a contractor here. I think it's about the rotting cells under the French doors. So I will at last sit down with my favorite section of the New York Times, the science section, Science Times, and look for something, a choice to help objectify my anxiety.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   Here's one. Unpredictable rogue asteroids.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   Just last year, an unknown rogue asteroid the size of Yankee Stadium was spotted just four days before it whipped by the Earth. That's a good one.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Oh, my God, look at this. Why Millstone reactor worries me. They have reopened the nuclear reactor in Waterford, Connecticut with an accidental release of radioactive material.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   The prevailing northwest wind could carry a radioactive plume over the north and south fork of Long Island, where we have just moved, causing an environmental catastrophe that could never be recuperated from 23,000 dead, they're estimating, because there's no evacuation plan.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   The Long Island Expressway?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Oh, no, this in the Science Times? It can't be. Studies show bicycle seats may cause impotence.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   The seat can compress two main arteries that run under the scrotum and feed the penis erect. Why now? Why? Just when I bought a bike? I mean, that's how I work up my anxieties.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Look, these three stories and four cups of coffee have left me horny.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   I got that lower base of the spine early morning itch. I'm wondering if it's too early to give Kathy a call and interrupt her. Kathy, want to take a break? Which is the euphemism for you do you want a quickie.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   With Forrest, in the old days with Forrest, it used to be, Forrest, honey, do you want to see a Barney video?
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   I never thought a purple dinosaur with cellulite could be such a turn on. Kathy and I would hear that Barney music and we'd get hot.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   But now with little Theo, he's nine months. He doesn't like videos. It doesn't take much to entertain him. A brown paper bag, fill it with band roll on, an unopened bottle of vitamin Cs and a hairbrush. He's happy.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   So I take the paper bag upstairs and put it on the floor by the bed. The bed is high enough so we were kind of out of his sight line.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And Kathy and I, whoop, strip to the buff row when we jump into bed and begin to quangle wangle and make the beast with two backs. And all of a sudden, and I'm careful not to look out the window to the north because you look right down at the Baptist church and the white picket fence. It's not a turn on.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   But if I get turned on and I want to maintain direction without a premature ejaculation, looking out of the historic cemetery does hell.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   I have to say it's all unique for me making love in the day like this. My loft had no windows in the bedroom so it was like a 24 hour dark sex cave, you see.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   But here now it's very, we're just getting into it when all of a sudden I hear what sounds like insane laughter coming from between Kathy's legs.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   He goes, ha ha ha ha, that tickles, that tickles. It's a tickle me Elmo doll. One of the kids has either put it in there or left it in there and oh my God, Kathy's laughing, Elmo's laughing, little Theo's laughing.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   I'm not laughing. I can't laugh and maintain an erection at the same time. I would love to be laughing.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   So I hurl a doll out of the bed and we get back into the hunky durriness of it all and just as we get back into it, we hear this guy downstairs yell, electrician.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Oh God, Kathy goes, God, I'm sorry. The electrician's come to check on the attic for Marissa's bedroom. She puts on her bathrobe and raises it.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   We'll do it later. We'll do it later when Theo's asleep. We'll do it out in the writer's studio. And I go, yeah, I bet. As I stagger into the bathroom and spray cold water on my jennies and get ready for my bike ride.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Now what does it take? Nothing to get ready really. I'm no spandex day glow gear head. I just dress like a 10 year old when I had a Schwinn. Tuck my corduroys into my sock, put an elastic around my pants and put on a windbreaker and I'm ready as I'm heading out.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Kathy stops me at the door and asks me if I would please hold Theo while she takes the electrician up to the attic. Once again now I have him squirming in my arms and I think, how to calm him? Oh, all I have to do is step outside.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Theo is my outdoor bliss kid born in that storm and I step out now into the yard and he just goes into a little awesome trance. He goes, ooh. As I hold him down like my new bliss eyes, like a little camera looking down through his head, I'm inhaling the bouquet of his head.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   As I aim him at the west wall, a wooden wall with English ivy on it and over it the wide yellowing mulberry trees that are in the neighbor's driveway there. And now panning him around the yard like a camera, I go past the corner of Carolyn Blackwood's house and Robert Lowell's last home looking like a giant wedding cake through fall foliage.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Past my writer's studio, which basically still is a sex pad in a storage room. I haven't gotten down to much writing yet. And now facing north, it's the north fence and two roses still, late summer roses where Theo goes, ooh.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Above this fence is Carlos and Maria's, the gables of their house, the next door neighbors. A lovely older retired couple, he's from Peru, she's from Australia, but they're like grandparents to our kids and we often go over there or come over.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   The only thing that's uncomfortable with is Carlos is one of those guys that collects jokes and is always trying new ones out on me. I'm not a good one to listen to jokes. They remind me of seventh grade math problems.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   I'm always afraid I'm going to miss one of the elements and then they have to fake the laughter like.
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Oh, but one he did tell me I will never forget, which I'll share with you. It's like a visual haiku. It's very quick and to the point it goes, a skeleton walked into a bar, ordered a glass of beer and a mop.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   Now turning Theo to the east, we see the pivot hedge, crosshatching of phone wires, the Catholic church now with a steeple and a cross against the clear autumn sky with a seagull now perched on top like a weather vane and turning him now to the house, the south.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   Our home, my first home really in my adult life, the straight up and down green clapboard Victorian looks like a doll's house really because of the French doors at the bottom which are around the kitchen and the living room.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   It looks like it's open where a giant's hand could reach in and pull the children out and on wild autumn nights, I've run out often and look back in at the children playing in front of the fireplace and then on the other side of the wall, unseen to them, the mother in the kitchen, cooking and cleaning and cooking and cleaning.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And now I take Theo and deliver him back to Kathy and take my trek bike out of the shed and I'm ready and just before I go, I'll take one quick pee, find a private corner on the yard. I've always said I'd never own a house where you couldn't pee privately in the yard.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:57.000]   And with a seagull flying overhead, I empty myself and get on that bike and I'm off and I think, "Why did it take me so long to get out of that house?"
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   How quickly my head clears as I ride past the historic cemetery on my left and turn down Jermaine Avenue with the Oakland Cemetery now on my left. How I love these cemeteries. There's such great negative space. You kind of hope they won't develop there.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   As I'm riding now, and once you get out of the town of Saigaba, which is really quite a pristine little Victorian village, you are out into the geography of nowhere or anywhere as I ride down Noiack Road. I could be in Huntington, Babylon, Amityville, Syosset.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   It's a homogeny of random chaotic styles. Row houses, ranch houses, split levels with fake brass carriage lamps, beach bungalows, three million dollar baronic trophy homes with four chimneys, five car garages plunked down in the middle of potato fields unlandscaped used two months out of the year.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Final sided clapboard colonials, oversized large load white shrink wrapped power boats balanced like huge Clorox bottles on undersized trailers. Boston whalers and rusting Buicks for sale, Jeeps for sale, night crawlers, firewood, put your own pumpkins here,
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   hot rods, speed boat, lobster pot snails, oh the stupefying clutter of it all. And all of a sudden, pow, I'm out and riding my bike now along the water, along the bay, shockeroo, it's an out of season million dollar Caribbean blue, and the wind is behind me pushing me on now as I get energy off of the water.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   And riding now out under route 114, coming in for my final lap, roadkill, dead deer stinking over there in the gut of dead squirrels there, oh 7-11 coffee cups, about 40 of them in one pile there, same contractors dumping them out as they turn to work on that house.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   Ah, there ought to be a law, there is. And all of a sudden, I feel that tingling in my crotch. I'm losing the circulation.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   I stop the bike and walk it. I stop, as I always do with my bike, and get off and look out over the town because it is the only slight rise in which you can see now the town in the distance, it looks like it has a medieval wall around it of condos, restaurants, a marina, and there nestled behind it is the Victorian colonial town like a little pop-up village.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   And saving it from being calendar art is this one giant 100 foot high blue gas ball that looks like a giant pool ball that just rolled into town and stopped.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   And I think if only I could oversee, look at this town, if there was only a hill, that's the only thing that was missing, that I could go up and have that God's eye view.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   And remember, having it once, flying back from England with my family in a 747, we went right over Syke Harbor in the daylight and looked down and saw the Whalers Church and our home in Long Wharf, in all 2009 people, the population of the town in winter, about the size of an average A train at rush hour in New York City.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And now as I stand there, I remember that first day when I did this ride and how I got off my bike and thought, if I stand here long enough, I mean I had felt like I had last come back to the place I started from, I was about to know it for the first time.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   In putting my arms around myself, I thought, if I stand here long enough, I will at last feel as though I belong. I will last feel connected to this earth. And I stood there and nothing happened but motion and the water running under me and the feeling of transiency, impermanence, change.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   And I thought the best and most honest thing I could do was get on my bike and be in motion. And now I hear the noon whistle and I know that I will go down to the IGA to shop for lunch with all the other workers as they put their burden down.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   I will go down to that little teeny IGA on the middle of Main Street. It's like an Eastern European store. It has one of some things. No paralysis of choice there. As I stand in the line with the other workers, ordering ham salad, peppered farm bread, a can of Campbell's tomato soup, me, Ozzie Russo.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   And I go back and make lunch and Kathy and I and Theo eat it at the round table in the dining room. And it's noon on Wednesday, October 8, 1997.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   After lunch, I think I would love to do something with my hands, something manual. If only I could, what could it be? And I think I could cut the lawn because I have a hand mower. The lawn is small enough to cut it with a hand mower. And also as a kid, I grew up with a hand mower.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   In fact, never graduated to power mowers. I got disillusioned with my community and hand mowers and moved to New York City, escaped. And started instead of a family, an experimental theater collective. That was my substitute for a family. Instead of living in the real world, we deconstructed American classics and made our own world in the windowless art house of the performing garage.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   And I remember we deconstructed Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. I'd known the play because I'd been in a traditional four-hour production of it and took the script and underlined all my favorite lines in red. It came to seven minutes.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   And we staged it with the Worcester group. Elizabeth the Klump directed it and choreographed it to Berlioz's Roman Carnival Overture, which is also, by the way, seven minutes long. And it was a wild production. Willem Dafoe played the mother, Mary, in drag.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   I played James Tyrone in a smoking jacket. A smoke machine going, guns going off, Berlioz playing. And at some point I did this lawn mower dance that Liz choreographed with a hand mower, a yellow hand mower. And I did that lawn mower dance so many times, I did it more than I ever had cut a lawn with a hand mower, that the hand mower turned into an object of art, really.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   And now as I stand here in the lawn on Zack Harbor with my hand mower, I feel like I'm waiting for the play to begin. I feel like Ozzie Russo being played by Spalding Gray, who is playing at being a family man.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   And I begin to act as though I'm cutting the grass. And the grass goes down as though it's being cut.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   And out of the corner of my good eye, I spy Kathy now, crossing behind me, dressed in dungarees, barefoot in a bra, headed for the writer's studio.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   And I say, "Oh, I love that woman. She's such an initiator. She's such a phallic gal." And I suddenly turn into the gardener.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   And I go over and meet her at the door to the writer's studio and we pass in without speaking.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   I finish cutting the lawn about 2.15, 2.30, and I think, "Oh, wait, maybe I have time for sale on my little boat." And I go, "No, no, it's time to pick Forrest up. I can't believe it.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   It's time to pick him up at kindergarten." And I used to love to pick him up at preschool the year before because he'd see me and streak out, "Daddy!"
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   I'd grab him and hurl him around, swing him around in my arms. I thought that would go on for years. At least five.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   Now they parade him out and he lines up against a hurricane fence. I have to pick him out. He doesn't run out. I have trouble recognizing him.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   And I go, "Oh, hi, honey." "Oh, God, can I still call him honey?" And all the other fathers are there going, "Yo, sport. Hey, fella. Hey, come on, guy. Hey, let's get cracking. Hey, bud. Hey, come on, come on. Whoa, dude. Awesome. Whatever. We're out of here."
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   "Hi, sweetie. Did you have a good day?" "We're going to go downtown and get a video." We don't have a television at our house. We've managed to keep it out.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   And so we do have a monitor. We watch videos. I saw a forest exposed to a TV in Martha's Vineyard. We had cable. He would get up in the morning, eat his cereal and run on the TV.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   Four hours later, we'd shut it off and go to the ocean and he'd be banging his head on a couch like a heroin addict in withdrawal. "What am I going to do?"
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   I said, "You're going to go to the ocean and play in the waves, but think of all the shows I'll miss."
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   No TV. Channels lead to channels. Endlessly. Video has a beginning, a middle, and an end. So we're going to go get a video, rent a video, but first we'll go get your bike and ride downtown.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   So we start across the schoolyard and Forrest starts in on his list of etymological derivation questions, which we go through. And he goes, "Dad, can I tell you something?
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Why do they call a road a road?" I told you, I'm still struggling with the English language myself. I don't know a lot of the derivations of these.
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   "Dad, can I tell you something? How do cars come into the world?" I suddenly see a seventh grade science film I remember as a kid with Ed Herlihy.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   It's a big Bessemer furnace. I remember that. It's a stumping molten what? Steel, metal, iron. What's the difference between metal, steel, and iron?
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   They call it Steel Town, don't they? Or Iron City. "Wait, I see a conveyor belt." By now he's already on to something else.
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   "Dad, I think I know why they call a fish a fish." "Why, honey?" "Because it has a fin that begins with 'fuh', Dad. Fuh, fuh, fuh."
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   "Dad, I know why they call a hotel a hotel." "Why, sweetie?" "Because when the family gets to the hotel, they all laugh. They go ho, ho, ho, ho, ho."
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:34.000]   And then they tell Dad. They tell about what happened on the way there. At home now, I go get his bike out of the writers' studio, and it's got the little train of wheels.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   He insists on me getting his helmet. "What is a five-year-old doing wearing a crash helmet to ride on the sidewalk?"
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   I don't know, but I get it. He looks like a purple cockroach in the thing. It's so weird looking.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   And we begin our ride downtown. Now, it's a short trip to the Long Wharf video. But with Forrest, he cannot ride and ask questions at the same time.
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   And he's constantly talking, so he breaks the talk. It's going to be an afternoon project.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   And so we start down. "Dad, can I tell you something?" "What?" "Aliens don't have armpits, Dad."
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   "How do you know, Forrest?" "I just do." "Dad, can I tell you something?" "Sure, sweetie. I know what's inside ghosts."
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:22.000]   "What?" "Nothing, Dad." "And what is nothing, Forrest?" "Nothing's just a word, Dad." "Dad, 'oh my' is not a bad word, is it?"
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   First of all, 'oh my' is two words. Second of all, there's no bad words. I told you that before.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   No, my teacher said I can't say, "Oh my God, Dad." I can't say, "Oh my God."
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   Forrest, you can say anything you want. You have my permission now. You can say, "God." You can say, "Oh." You can say, "God, my 'oh.'"
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   Let's go over this again. There is no such thing as a bad word until you put it in context.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   Then it begins to take on bad. We'll talk about that later, all right? Let's just start with...
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   All right, we don't have a bad word. Let's make one up. Let's write it in the sky here.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   Let's take a good bad word. Now, there's a concept, Forrest. A good bad word.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   What would be a good bad word over at your school? "Shit, I bet shit would be one."
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   Let's do it. We don't have it yet. Let's start with S. Is that a bad letter? No. Does it smell? No.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   My name begins with S. Let's say I have a snakey letter. S-H. Bad? No. I. That's still not bad.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   I. T. There it is. Shit. Is that bad? Does it smell? No.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Don't mistake it with the thing in the toilet, you see. That's the substance. That's the thing in itself.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   The word is a signifier only. You see, in a way...
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   In a way, I think the Bible had it wrong. At least the book of John. He says, "In the beginning was the word.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Exodus was closer." In the beginning...
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   In the beginning, God created. Forget about God. Just think about creation. We'll do God later.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   Just think. In the beginning, the creation. So we have the act first. The creation.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   Then we have the substance, the thing in itself. Then we have the naming of the thing in itself.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   So the word is quite a ways down the line. Don't you see, Forrest? Look, let me show you another thing.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   I'm going to take a stick here. I'm going to take a stick and write the word "shit" in the dirt.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Will that make it dirty? Just the opposite. It's an absence of dirt because I have to carve the dirt out, you see.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   Maybe I'm trying to tell him too much. Are you alright, Dad?
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   I have to stop at the bank. He has no interest in coming into work. Who would?
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:26.000]   I mean, I can't imagine my father taking me out of a car and sticking it in a metallic crack
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   and watching Fresh 20s come out of another metallic crack. As I'm over in the corner counting them, I come out.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   He's given peace signs as he rides down the road. His babysitter, Theresa, ex-merchant marine, taught him how to do the peace sign.
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   Why do they call a bank a bank, Dad? Oh, I don't know. Forrest, please. A bankman, I guess.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   Something like a river bank. Water in, money out. I don't know. We're outside the five and dime now.
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   I think he wants to go into the five and dime and get something. No. Do you want to go in? No, I'm fine.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   Where does he get that little quick adult cocktail hour response? Like, can I freshen your drink? No, I'm fine.
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   He is such a non-acquisitor. I love that about him, really. I mean, I fell in love with Forrest when I'd see him with his balloons.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   He wasn't even two. Baboona. He would love balloons, but after a little while he just let it go and watched it go up.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   I saw kids cry for hours at a lost balloon. I fell in love with him again when he was making cupcakes.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   We were making cupcakes and his sister was away for the month of August. And the first cake he made, he was going to save for her until September and kept it until then.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   I fell in love with him again that first Halloween in Sag Harbor when we were downtown trick-or-treating.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:44.000]   And Marissa, his sister, wanted to go uptown to the big houses and Forrest wanted to go home because he said he had enough, enough candy.
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   And when we got home, he gave away our candy and when we ran out, he went out with his and started chasing the kids down the street when they wouldn't come to the door with his candy.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   Past the liquor store now. Past the IGA. I'm looking around thinking, this town is so empty. And mainly empty of sexy women.
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   What a relief. What a relief. After 30 years in New York City, I got to the point where I couldn't go out of my loft.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   I would be like, "Is she real? Get thee behind me, Satan!"
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   My head is not turning anymore. I have all this new energy freed up to, well, I'll find out. I'll find something. I mean, spend more time with my sons.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   Can I tell you something? Why are deer poops so small, Dad? Because a deer is like a horse and a poop is like a rabbit.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:45.000]   That's another good question, Forrest. I'm going to look that up in the Encyclopedia Britannica when I get home. I knew I bought those books from that traveling salesman for a reason.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   Dad, can I take one more thing? We're almost at the video store. Dad, why can't we feel the earth spin?
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   That's another good question. I'll look that up, too, because I'm sure it's spinning now, Forrest.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   Dad, what, sweetie? How do flies celebrate? What? How do flies celebrate? And then it comes to me, basically by flying from one pile of poop to another.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:19.000]   And we both laugh together as we pass the 18th century windmill, pass the 17th century stocks, and go into long-war video.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   Now, Forrest knows exactly what he wants. James and the Giant Peach. To me, he's recommending the Nutty Professor because he saw it with his sister and mom and said, "I would like the fart jokes."
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   So off he goes to get it. I'm getting the Nutty Professor. The woman running the video store goes, "Nutty Professor? Is that your son?"
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   I said, "Yeah, not for the little boy." "Oh, really? He already seen it. He recommended it to me."
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   We're not long for this town, Kathy. We're not long for this town. Forrest went to Montauk on a field trip and he was telling one of his friends, quite loud, he was speaking quite loud, that he knew how babies were born.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   The penis goes into the vagina. Now, the woman from preschool called, the teacher called Kathy and said, "I think the other parents should be warned what their children were exposed to today."
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   We're not long for this town, Kathy. We're not long for this town. So I rent it. I rent the Nutty Professor. He rents James and the Giant Peach and we're going out the video store.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   And I see an esoteric shelf and on it I see a video of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, of all things, narrated by Leonard Cohen.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   And I think, it says, "See animated spirits come out of skull. A must-see." So I rent that. So outside we got James and the Giant Peach and the Nutty Professor and the Tibetan Book of the Dead.
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   And Forrest always goes over the videos and wants to read them and he says, "What is this one, Dad?" I said, "That's the Tibetan Book of the Dead."
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   "Well, what's it about, Dad?" "Oh, I'll have to talk to you about it later." "Oh, I get it. You don't want to spoil it for me."
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   Outside, now, I insist we walk out onto Long Wharf. The kids don't understand, as soon as I get close to the water, I've got to get really close to it, empty out my head.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   I love to walk out onto that wharf and fantasize the whaling ships coming into that very wharf and unloading the barrels of whale oil.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   I like to look down at the marina down there at Saighaba Yat-Yat to see if my little beetle cat is in, the little day sailor. I thought we'd be sailing so much together as a family, but we went out once, God.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Kathy was pregnant with Theo and Marissa and Forrest. Forrest was lying on the bottom of the boat with a bottle of apple juice staring up at the sky, saying, "When are we going to be home?"
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   And every time the boat would heal, Marissa, who was, I guess, ten at the time, would cry out, "Help! Help! Coast God! Coast God! I don't want to die a virgin!"
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   So starting up to our return trip now, we go past the American Hotel, past the wonderful toy store where Forrest stops and only looks in the window. I'm fine. I'm loving this boy so much today, I want to treat him. So we go to the Cove Harbor Deli, I want to give him a treat, and he really outdoes me.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:23.000]   He says, instead of ordering a Coke, he orders an Orangina, because he doesn't want to be hyper. And I get a pole and spring water, and we sit there at the round tables with all these old retired guys that are sitting there looking out the window, waiting.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   And Forrest says, "Dad, can I tell you something?" "What, sweetie?" "What if you were Howard Stern?" So Forrest, that question confounds me, really. If I were Howard Stern, this would not be the world that we're living in now. I mean, all I know, Dad, is that Mom wouldn't like it.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   Why, Forrest? Because he's fart man. Well, I am fart man sometimes myself, not on stage or not. Oh no, but remember that time, and I began to tell him just a year before when we were going to rent a car in New York City at Davis to go out and look at houses in Sag Harbor, I'd been very nervous about shopping for houses, and also I thought I had a cold coming on.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   And so I had a few pieces of raw garlic in the morning, and then a whole handful of vitamin Cs, and then I had one of those spinach feta cheese omelets for breakfast, so I was letting go with those silent, deadly, slow, hot burners as I was filling out the Davis car rental thing, not taking responsibility for them.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Forrest, though, who happened to be at nose level, cries out, "Dad just farted!" The entire Davis car rental is, they're breaking up, they're weeping with laughter.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   There's one woman on the telephone laughing so hard, Kathy thinks that she's calling page six, the gossip column, to report this because she recognized me from beaches.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   We start out of the harbor deli now, and start up for the last run, headed for home, and Forrest says, "Dad, maybe this is inspired by the historic cemetery," and I left, but he says, "Tell me a scary story, Dad."
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:22.000]   So Forrest, "You know, I've told you before, I don't know how to make anything up." "No, no, Dad, Dad, please, tell me a scary story." Forrest, look around you. This is the scary story.
[01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   "No, sweetie, I don't mean that. Listen, you know how Daddy likes to tell true stories and stories from my life. I've always wanted to tell you a story, but you're always too young to have a history, now you do.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   You're old enough, and I'm going to tell you a story about yourself when you were three years old, and I bet you don't remember this. We all went to New Orleans. I always wanted to go to New Orleans.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   At last, I was able to get the whole family down there. Theo wasn't born yet, and it was Sunday morning, and I loved the street music down there, and people were just waking up and coming out with their instruments, having their first morning drinks.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Mom was in the hat store with Marissa buying a hat, and I took her into a little novelty shop, and you had bought this little souvenir. It was a rubber alligator, and I had you in the stroller, and we came upon this Dixieland band that was rocking, and there was a crowd of people around it.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   And you began to beat that rubber alligator on your knee for us like this, keeping perfect rhythm, and we found out it had a squeaker in it. So every time it hit your knee, it was squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, and they were all jamming. Everyone's doing a solo, and all of a sudden the woman on clarinet just stops the whole band except the bass and gestures to you.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   You're still rocking, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, and all you can hear is the bass going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak, and then everyone clapped. I cannot tell you how proud I was, Forrest.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   I had a three-year-old son doing his first rubber alligator solo in New Orleans. Up in the attic now, I get him settled away with James and the Giant Peach, put it on the monitor, and make sure that he feels secure up there, and start down the attic stairs, and I think, "Oh, God, Marissa, where is she? I'm neglecting her. I don't know. I may be paying too much attention to the boys.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   I hope maybe she's on a play date. I mean, at 11 years old, those play dates are so intense. They're like obsessive love affairs for a week, and then they're not speaking to each other for a month. Maybe she's on a good play date now that's working.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   I do the best I can with her. I wait till she comes to me. I don't know what she needs. I wait for her to ask, and sometimes it is difficult for me to tolerate her because I don't have that built-in, unconditional love that I experienced for the boys, but I'm giving her a good home.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   Maybe she's on the phone to her father. She's always doing that. He helps her with her homework. I can't. I mean, I don't know if he's smarter than I am or what, but I'm telling you, I looked down at her math book the other day and got nauseous.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   I got dizzy. It read, "The greater of two numbers is seven more than the lesser. Three times the greater number is five more than four times the lesser number. Find the numbers." What numbers? Don't you have to start with numbers?
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   But she's really doing well. Her 11-year-old girl is caught between two parents that hate each other and can only relate through lawyers. I mean, she goes to visit her father, and it's like an iron curtain comes down. She doesn't take calls. She doesn't call out.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   I don't know what her father's angry about. I mean, he was the one that ran off on them and left Marissa and Kathy when Marissa was two, ran off with a Sears and Roebuck underwear model. And when that fell apart, he came back, and Kathy didn't take him back. That's why he's angry about it, because she moved to New York City without him.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   And he was a fan of mine, actually. No longer a fan. He had introduced Kathy to the video, Swimming to Cambodia. She said, "Why do I want to stay home and watch one man talking when we could go out dancing?" She watched it. She liked it. She booked me at a theater she was booking at up in Rochester, and that's where we met.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   And then when she moved to New York City, we continued to meet, and that's where I first met her daughter, Marissa. At the time then, Marissa was, I guess she was two or three years old. When I first met her, it was at a party in downtown. She couldn't really, didn't know who I was, although she heard the name Spalding Gray. She couldn't get her imagination around it. She referred to me as Splendid Cafe, which I think would make a very good stage name if I ever had to take it on.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   So she was three years old at this party. She arrived with a clipboard claiming she was Madonna's publicist. And we made eye to eye contact. She was darling, she was cute, and I think she knew who I was, and I said, "My name is Spalding, and I'm going to go into the kitchen and sit down. When you're ready to have a talk with me, please come in and join me." She never came in.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   And when we finally moved in together, she was six, and I realized what we had in common. Really, we were both self-indulgent drama queens. Although she got to do it because she was six.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:15.000]   By that, I mean, both of us, I think, felt that life is a rehearsal. You know, everyone's saying, "Life is not a rehearsal." No, it is for Marissa, and for me, in the sense of always looking for the perfect story and the perfect audience, in a sense.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   I mean, I can remember when I was at home, taking care of Marissa and Forrest, and I heard this crashing on the attic stairs, and ran up to see what happened, and there was Marissa, at the bottom of the stairs, acting as though she was dead or unconscious.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   I knew she was acting because I'm an actor. And I went down and got a whole pile of ice and put it in a towel and wrapped it, and came up and acted as though I was reviving her. And she got up and acted fine.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   Now this kind of acting out, and I would never call her on it, began to change, I remember, when she got a, for her, it was a devastating phone call from her father.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   He called to announce, of course, they knew it was coming, but they had given birth, his wife had given birth to a son, and now Marissa had yet another half-brother to deal with, and was no longer the center of that family, and she tried to be very sweet to her father on the phone.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   I could hear she was really acting. And said, "I love you," when she hung up, and she ran upstairs to the attic. And I followed her, I went up as far as the second floor and then listened to the mile in the attic stairs, and she just began to wail and cry.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   And cry and cry in a way that was so connected, I let her go through it alone, I had never heard her cry like that.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   And shortly after that, another event happened in the family that was very powerful, and it was the death of Marissa's great-grandmother, Kathy's grandmother.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   And it was very unifying for all of us, because it was the first death in our particular nuclear family, first open Catholic casket funeral I'd ever been to, which was an odd event to see that body laid out like that, so real and natural looking as though it would pop up and ask for chocolate.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   And Marissa would hang out by the open casket and would interview people about their memories about her nonna, her great-grandmother, and then actually also touch the body out of curiosity, and then read a poem just before the casket was taken to the church.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   It read, "I just touched my nonna, she was cold still and no life, no more smiles on nice warm happy days, no more joy that filled the air with the sweet smell of love, no more meatballs in Florida.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   Oh, nonna, you are gone, gone, gone, and we know not where. Everyone rushed to Marissa, the priest, the nun, Kathy's mother, Marissa, dear, we know where nonna is, she's in heaven now, dear." Marissa goes, "Heaven? What a bore!"
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   What a strange, quick imagination, strict, quick imagination Marissa has. I can remember we had a party, we were having a party in Martha's Vineyard, and there had been this clumping on the roof before, the whole family, we thought it was a dog the day before the party,
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   and we went out and it was like a neurotic, overweight seagull, it was just running back and forth, it couldn't take off for some reason. We just left it alone.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   We're having this party, and Marissa, by the way, starts the party out with her version of Carlos' joke about a skeleton walking into a bar ordering a glass of beer and a mop.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   Hers is, a skeleton walks into a bar, orders a glass of wine and a broom, and a little further into the party, a woman says, "What on earth is that noise on the roof?"
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   And Marissa goes, "It's a seagull, and I don't like it one bit." And the woman says, "Why?" And she says, "Because it's not paying rent."
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:57.000]   A little further into the party, the same woman says she believes in the possibility of human change. And Marissa goes, "Absolutely, why look at the Unabomber, he was a professor and he became a bomber."
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   I really think she's going to make a good trial lawyer as I stand there now at the bottom of the stairs in the hallway.
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   The sun is in the west now, and it's causing the whole hallway to go to an amber light, and I think, "Maybe if I stand here for a bit, I'll feel like I belong to the house?"
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   And I pass into Kathy's office, our library, she must be out with Theo, and I am alone at last for the books on the Encyclopedia Britannicas.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   And I take down D and look up deer, and nothing. I find nothing about poop.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   I look up earth, 47 pages on the earth, and nothing about spinning. And I think, "Oh, I'm such an unconscious Luddite. If only I had learned to type, then I could work one of these computers or webs and plug in poop and spin and I'd be home free."
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   But how I love my books, I think, the ones I brought out from New York, to be surrounded by them, to pull them down, and to see them all underlined in red so profusely, and to reread those passages I thought were so important so many years ago, and to feel the weight of the open encyclopedias in my lab.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   But as I look around, I am a bit bothered, I guess, for the first time, now that I have children, how many of the books are about death, or not really about death, but books with death in the title, books that are about dealing with the not knowing, or the mystery of death, I would say, which they were more about.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   And a great pile of them, and I remember saying to my friend Ken, "You know, I get so annoyed when I see these books on the bestseller list about near-death experiences. What do you think is the popularity of those, Ken, about people really feeling like they know?"
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   And Ken goes, "Well, Spalt, you know, there's near-death, and then there's DEATH!" But I don't know what to tell Forrest, I did the best I could with it, I just told him the truth, I mean, he came to me quite young, he must have been just four, and wanted to know about it, and I said, "That's one of the conditions, that everyone that is born will die."
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   I mean, it's a sure thing, it's a comforting thing, and a surety, I mean, in a way, and the other funny thing, or odd thing, I would say, Forrest, because I don't think there's anything funny about death, is that everyone knows they're going to die, but no one really believes it.
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   And I think, when I told him this, he believed it, or he was in denial, I don't know, my friend Stokes said, "You shouldn't be telling him things like that so early on." He'll say, "Why bother doing anything?"
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   Now, when my younger brother, Shannon, had my niece, Amanda, his daughter, started asking about it, he just said, "Reincarnation, you come back," and that took care of it.
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   Kathy wants the children baptized, because she's been a baptized Catholic, and she's afraid she'll end up in heaven without them, a noble sentiment, I say!
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   I'm open to it, so we had the minister come over from the Whaling Church, and talk to us about the baptismal, or high Episcopalian, I guess it was, and that we would have to, as a whole family, accept Christ in front of the congregation.
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   And I knew that I would not, simply not, know how to do that, would have no inkling to it, and I felt bad, because I do want to end up with the family.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   But I remind myself that after I talk about death, I must always, and do, kiss Forrest, and say, "But it's going to be alright, everything's going to be alright, and I love you, Forrest, I love you, I love you."
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   And as I'm thinking these thoughts, I begin to fall into a late afternoon kind of hypoglycemic doze, and into my sleep comes and creeps the disembodied voice of death, which is as frightening to me as Chucky is to Forrest.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   Only I can save Forrest from Chucky, and no one can save me from the disembodied voice.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   So, Mr. Gray, here I am again, just as you're relaxing, to once more remind you that all you think you are will one day, sooner or later, disappear forever, as though it never existed.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   But what about my children? And they'll have children, and they're children's children, that's something though, isn't it? Come on!
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   Need I remind you, Mr. Gray, that you once said, "If I ever have children, please, let it be late in life so I will be dead by the time they're teenagers."
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   Oh, but I've changed, really. No, I want grandchildren now, I want to be able to hold them, smell their heads, I've changed.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Of course you have. They all do. Must I say it again? Very well, I will say it again.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   Your children, and your children's children, will pass and disappear as you did, for all things are subject to change.
[01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   Which is really just a nice word for death.
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   But what about the planets, you see, the Earth?
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:55.000]   Need I remind you, even the sun will burn out one day, and no one will be left to say, "Here we have been."
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   It will be as though it never happened. In fact, doesn't it already feel a little bit like that now?
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   What am I to do in the face of this, except recollect over and over obsessively, just recalling and remembering?
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   Keep it up, Mr. Gray. You live in a future that doesn't exist, and a past that is no longer.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   But really, I am making a pretty good living at it, don't you think?
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   Ha ha ha ha. I'm laughing. Take a break, sweetie. Try enjoying life for a change. See if you can. Love Kathy, love your children, love yourself.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   Don't waste time thinking about me, or plenty of time to catch up later.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:43.000]   But the books, you see, all the books in my library are telling me that there's no way that we can-
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   The books. Ah, the books. Words, words, words. Remember, there's the disembodied voice of death, and then there's-
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   Yes!
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   And I wake from that dream like Ebenezer Scrooge waking on Christmas morning.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   I wake to the sound of the news downstairs, and the smell of lamb stew in the kitchen, and Kathy's cooking it, and Marissa's making shiffy rolls in the oven.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   And Theo's in his high chair, and I come down and I think, oh, and I get out the Bloody Mary mix.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   And I think, oh, the warm family circle. What a little vodka, tomato juice, and won't do to the disembodied voice of death.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   As I make my first Bloody Mary now, and go in and start the fire in the fireplace, and sit in my wing-back chair, sipping my Bloody Mary.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   I'm fantasizing now that I'm a bachelor writer in a New Hampshire writer's colony working on my eighth novel.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   And then go into the kitchen to be the family man again, and mix with the family. Telephone rings, dammit all, it's Marissa's father.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   She takes the phone and goes upstairs to talk with him secretly. Why does he always call at suppertime? Dammit all!
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   And Kathy says, "Please, don't bother with him now. Help me get ready for dinner. Go set the table."
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   "No, bring in Theo's high chair. Better still go get Marissa to help you set the table. She should do it."
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   "Marissa, get off the phone, please, and come down and set the table."
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.000]   She comes to the top of the stairs and goes, "How much are you going to pay me?"
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   "What? You watch it, young lady. This is not a hotel here. This is a family project. Come down here and help out."
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   I am amazed how the children have liberated my anger. It's just a great thing.
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   Why, when I was in these two relationships with Liz and Renee, I was passive aggressive.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   If I got angry at them, I wouldn't be able to contact them, and then I'd provoke anger at them, so they'd get angry at me, and I'd feel my anger coming back at me through them.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:43.000]   It was very confusing. Now it's very clear and direct to the children I can even turn it on Kathy, which is so healthy.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   Marissa's down now, setting the table with attitude like a slave princess.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.000]   Forrest comes in and sits down. Theo comes in and is bucking. Kathy gets him into the high chair.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000]   She goes, "Oh, I smell a poopy diaper." Forrest goes, "Don't say that word 'poopy' when I'm about to eat."
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:09.000]   "Oh, Forrest, you see, that's an example of a word in context. Poopy suddenly becomes a bad word for you."
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:15.000]   "It's not a bad word for me because I don't mind the smell. It smells like an overripe exotic French cheese to me."
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   Marissa goes, "Spalding, please." I said, "Marissa, you're not trying to censor me at my dinner table, are you?"
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   She goes, "Your dinner table? I thought this was a family project. You watch it, young lady. You're acting like..."
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:31.000]   Kathy says, "Stop it. You're treating her like an adult." "Oh, she's acting like an all-knowing adult."
[01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:35.000]   Marissa goes, "Maybe I am. Maybe you're not. Maybe I am. Maybe you're not. Maybe I am. Maybe you're not."
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:41.000]   Kathy suddenly sees that little Theo has got my reading glasses on. He looks like Truman Capote. We all turn.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   Everyone laughs. The whole mood of the table has completely changed.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   And we pull back. And now, "Oh, Forrest, sit around. Sit around at your chair now. Sit around and sit up and eat with the fog."
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   "You're not my boss. I never wanted to be a father. I didn't want to be a cop. I didn't want to be a superego figure.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:06.000]   I only wanted to be a sweet old uncle. I'm not your boss. If I'm not your boss, who is?"
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   Kathy says, "Easy, easy. Forrest, I don't want to be your boss. I just want to be your guide. I want to be your guide.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   I want to facilitate to the stew." Kathy's gourmet lamb stew. "Please, let's all eat."
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   We take a first bite of the lamb stew and Marissa pulls out a little speck and goes, "What's this weird spice?"
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   So Marissa, "That's not spice. That's an herb. It's rosemary from Kathy's herb garden."
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:41.000]   "From the garden? Has it been sterilized?" Marissa, "The garden is of the earth. You are of the earth. Have you been sterilized?"
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:47.000]   "Please, Dad, you're food obsessed." Forrest says, "Forrest!" "Can I get Lunchables, Mom?"
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:53.000]   "What?" "Mom, please, can I get Lunchables?" "You're going to let them get that cold pizza kit?"
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:26:00.000]   Marissa wants it too. "It is not worth fighting over food. We can freeze the lamb stew. If they'd rather eat Lunchables, fine."
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   They go get them. They bring them out and they stop making cold pizza at the table. "I am eating the lamb stew. I am steaming."
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:10.000]   Kathy says, "All right, please, please, let's change the subject. Let's talk about school. What happened to you today?"
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   "It's cool, Marissa. Anything interesting?" Now the whole table conversation changed and Marissa goes, "Well, the big news is this. Holly Marin walked home with a boy."
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:31.000]   Kathy goes, "What's wrong with that? I mean, really, don't you have just like a little crush on someone? Just a little one?"
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   She goes, "Nope." Forrest goes, "Yes, she does. Leonardo." Marissa goes, "Not anymore. I found out he's bisexual and he smokes."
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   Okay, I say, "Marissa, what would your ideal crush situation be? I mean, if you had a real ideal crush situation, what would it be?"
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:10.000]   And she goes, "Well, I look at it this way." She goes, "I see myself getting a scholarship to Oxford. And there at Oxford, I just happen to go to a Spice Girls concert.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:22.000]   And Prince Harry spies me and falls desperately in love. Now this makes his brother, Prince William, so jealous that he steals me away and marries me and I become queen."
[01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:33.000]   Marissa the first. Maybe excused. Oh my God, it's great. Wow. Where'd she learn that? Her father, she's excused herself as she took her plate out. That's hope.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   And Forrest now follows her with his Lunchables and the whole family goes downtown for ice cream.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   Kathy gets out that 1948 pram she got at a tag sale and we stroll out. It looks like we're stepping into a sound stage for our town.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   No one's out there. We're the only family that walks.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   We get ice cream and come back and Kathy puts Theo down. He's asleep and goes up to read to Forrest and Marissa.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:12.000]   I finish putting the last of the dishes in the dishwasher and then go up to the attic.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   But Kathy has just finished reading to Forrest and she goes to the far end of the attic to Marissa.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:29.000]   And I sit down beside Forrest and turn off his little bed light and amazed to see now up through the skylight above his bed, we can see the stars.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:38.000]   And it is a vivid October night. There are no shopping plazas or malls to wipe the night sky clean.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   And Forrest goes, "Dad, look at the stars. It's incredible." He goes, "Dad, can I tell you something? What's on the other side of them?"
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   Forrest, "We don't know that." "No, no, no, dad, dad, dad, dad, dad." "See the stars?" "Yes." "What's beyond them?"
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   Forrest, "That's a mystery we haven't solved here on earth yet. We really don't know." "No, no, no, dad, dad. See the stars?"
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   Forrest, "Please stop a minute and look at me." "What have I been telling you about the stars?"
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   And he looks up at me and goes, "Shitty caca pea bone penis breath." And I kiss him goodnight and go to leave.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   And he calls me back and says, "Dad." "What, sweetie?" "I am so glad you met mom or I would have been stuck inside a sperm forever."
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   And I go to the far end of the attic to kiss Marissa. Goodnight. She's lying there reading. She's alternating between Wives of Henry VIII and Teen People.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:06.000]   And I kiss her and I meet Kathy at the top of the stairs and we start down. And we crash into bed and Kathy's going to read. She turns the light on.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   I kiss her and roll over in darkness. I am not doing any reading or watching its videos. It's 10.15 at night. And I am wrecked.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   I cannot believe it. And I haven't even gone to work. How do people do it? Work and raise a family. I say pray for the single mothers, I think, as I lie there in the dark.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   And it's all going to start again tomorrow. Over and over. But my God, it hasn't been a bad day. Really? I mean, really, really, I should count my blessings.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:49.000]   I mean, think of all that could go wrong. And I begin to.
[01:30:49.000 --> 01:31:03.000]   The Millstone reactor melting down, rogue asteroids, drug resistant bacteria, the Islamic Jihad, my bicycle seat, the pesticides in the water, the Long Island cancer clusters, childhood leukemia, chronic fatigue syndrome.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   What if Kathy got chronic fatigue syndrome? What would I ever do? And all of these are beginning to spin. All of these horrors like covers on Time and Newsweek, like a Ferris wheel, like a Wheel of Fortune, like a Tibetan book of living and dying.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:25.000]   It's making me so dizzy and nauseous that I have to pull out and grab something. And I reach back into my memory bank. And it's a story. And the story is we're back at the funeral.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:38.000]   Because that funeral of Kathy's grandmother, Forrest's great grandmother, was such a unifying factor for the family. The unspoken acknowledgement of death was more powerful than any Christmas could be for us in a way.
[01:31:38.000 --> 01:31:49.000]   As I remember now, sitting now in the cathedral, in the church, they have brought the casket in after Marissa has read her poem. And Forrest is sitting there beside me and the ceremony is going on.
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:32:00.000]   And the priest is saying, "And I implore you, do not grieve and mourn for Anne today, but rejoice and celebrate." And Forrest is going, "Dad, I gotta pee. I gotta pee. I gotta pee so bad, Dad."
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   I said, "Good. Let's get out of here. We'll go to the men's room. I gotta go too." So we go back into the men's room and they are, of all things, broadcasting the ceremony over speakers in the men's room. We can't get away from it.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:24.000]   "From this land of shadows into the glorious light you will pass in." And I, we're having the pee contest we used to have to see who can finish first. Of course, Forrest always wins because my bladder is much larger.
[01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:43.000]   But we're going at it and all of a sudden he looks over and goes, "Whoa, Dad, look at your penis." And I go, "Yeah, it's 56 years old and it's really been around." And he goes, "56 years old and it's not even a person."
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:33:03.000]   And I just feel such love for this child at this moment. Such love that I can't let it in, that it's too painful. Instead I see the epitaph go across the top of my skull, another one from that historic cemetery that reads, "It's a fearful thing to love what death can touch."
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   And it occurs to me that the greatest horror I could imagine is to fall dead there on that floor. And some part of me still floating up above, held by the gravity of love, not able to escape the earth but looking back above Forrest and not able to touch him, would be a version of hell.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:35.000]   And I reach down and I grab him and hold him and I think, "Oh, Forrest, child light of my life, even now as I hold you, I can feel time tearing you away."
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:53.000]   Ah, Theo. He's awake and Kathy's asleep. That means I go get to pick him out of the crib. And I go in and I lift him up and I feel that blessed weight again. Oh, Theo, Theo, my necessary anchor to the earth.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:34:11.000]   And I take him in and put him down beside Kathy and he bellies up to the milk bar and begins to tank up. And I'm lying there with him between us and he's kicking me. He's kicking me. And I'm going to sleep being kicked by my son.
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]   Thank you for coming.
