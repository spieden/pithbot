[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:06.640]   I think, I think it all began the summer I turned 50.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.760]   I was doing a storytelling workshop in upstate New York, and I had everyone in the workshop,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.540]   it was about 15 people, just sit in a circle at the beginning as a kind of centering exercise,
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.200]   and I asked them to look into each other's eyes without speaking.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.040]   And then they got tired of looking into one person's eyes to move on to someone else.
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:33.980]   And I was participating in this exercise, and I got locked in to this one woman's eyes.
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.300]   Her name was Azaria Thornbird.
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:45.160]   She was tall, blonde, blue eyes, about 36 years old, dressed in white, the immaculate conception.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.900]   And I got stuck in her eyes and could not get out, and as I was staring into her eyes
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.040]   in this kind of hypnotic gaze, I saw that her face was beginning to peel and drool off
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.320]   of her skull, like a bad LSD trip, like a horror movie, peeling down off of her skull.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.200]   And I kept staring, and all of a sudden her face turned into this oval ball of white light,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.080]   this pulsing ball of white light that was dilating my pupils as I was looking into it.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.600]   I'd never seen anything like it except on the cover of a Carlos Castaneda book.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.280]   And this pulsing ball all of a sudden came together in a point, boom, it shot out the
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.640]   window behind her head like a white tornado, and her face recomposed and was smiling back
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   at me.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.880]   And immediately, my logical, rational mind kicked in and went, "Um, that was a case of
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.040]   backlighting, wasn't it?"
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.880]   The window was behind her head, and that was causing my pupils to dilate.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:50.160]   It made things look, that was an extreme case of backlighting, that was, that was backlighting.
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.600]   So I got back home, and I was working on my, trying to finish my novel, Impossible Vacation.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.920]   And I was going over and over this particularly painful section about my mother's suicide,
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:07.720]   and I noticed that the print on the manuscript began to, like, break down and not hold up.
[00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.840]   And I didn't think it was the print.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.280]   I thought it was my eyes, you know, I thought it was something, eye fatigue, I thought.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.120]   So I began playing with my eyes a bit, and I can remember covering my left eye, and everything
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.760]   was pretty much in focus, the print seemed to hold together.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.560]   And then I covered my right eye, and I noticed that at no point could I ever get the manuscript
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.960]   in focus in my left eye, which kind of frightened me.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.200]   I mean, I thought if it had to do with glasses, I could get it in focus at some point.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.680]   It frightened me so much that I just kind of, like, ignored it, I mean, I just, I just
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.680]   wanted to go on writing.
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:46.520]   I mean, I was afraid it was some big horrible disease, like, you know, CMV retinitis or
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   a brain tumor.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.420]   I mean, I did get out Renee's big Mayo Family Clinic disease book, you know, it's, she gave
[00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.560]   it to me for Christmas, but I can't look at it, it's the size of Webster's Unabridged
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.560]   Dictionary.
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.260]   It's this big blue book with these graphic color photos of every disease, I mean, penis
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.280]   cancer, I never knew that existed before I saw this book, Galloping Melanoma, I couldn't
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.400]   even get to the section on eyes, I couldn't see it, I couldn't look at it.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.980]   So it took me about four months, really, to get the courage to go, just have a regular
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.800]   eye exam.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.280]   And I didn't have an optometrist, so I had one recommended to me by a friend, Dr. Schechter
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.080]   on the Upper East Side.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.880]   Now I went up for a standard exam, I didn't tell him anything about what I was going through,
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.840]   and he started in and looking in my right eye with a little light, and over to my left,
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.880]   and back to my right, and he goes to the left again with the light, and then he starts from
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.480]   my right eye, and then he goes back left, left, left, left, left, whew, he pulls down
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.760]   another instrument, left, all this energy, it's like a scene from General Hospital suddenly,
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.680]   except it's missing the dramatic music.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.680]   All this attention on the left eye, he finally pulls all the instruments away and says, I
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.080]   think you have a problem there with the retina of your left eye, but I can't tell you what
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:09.160]   it is because I'm not a retina specialist.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:17.960]   But I could recommend one to you, and I think you should go to him this afternoon.
[00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.320]   Now this threw me into quite a state, and he recommends that Dr. Mendel on the Upper
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.920]   West Side, so I'm charging across from the Upper East Side to the Upper West Side, running
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.800]   through Central Park with my hand over my right eye, looking at everything, oh my God,
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.960]   there's no straight lines here, the trees are like this, everything's a blur, the roller
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:39.080]   skaters are a big blur, and I get to the other side, and I go in and into the waiting room
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.880]   of Dr. Mendel's, and they put eye drops in my eyes, I didn't know why, and I sat there
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.080]   doing what I usually do when I go to any doctor's office, the waiting room situation, I just
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:53.080]   catch up on my reading, you know, people, people time in Newsweek, I mean, what else
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:02.260]   is there to do in a doctor's office, you certainly don't stare at the art.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.960]   So I was catching up, and what I didn't realize was that these drops they put in my eyes were
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.800]   dilating my pupils, they didn't tell me that, so here I was sitting in the waiting room
[00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.440]   slowly going blind, I thought, I mean, I couldn't read, the place just turned into a fuzz ball,
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:21.960]   and I was reduced to waiting in the waiting room, which is the worst.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.200]   And at last the nurse led me in, she had to lead me in, because I really couldn't see,
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.000]   I was so dilated, and got me in the examination chair, and Dr. Mendel introduces himself and
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.020]   gets out this large syringe, and tells me that he's going to shoot me up with some colored
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:39.520]   dye, well, why not?
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:43.580]   He's the doctor, you know, and he's one of these doctors, you really have to ask him
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.020]   everything he's doing, why are you doing this, and he tells me that he's doing it because
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.740]   in order to, he wants to photograph my eye, in order to do color slides of it, you have
[00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:55.340]   to see the vessels in it and have the colored dye in to show up, and see if any of the vessels
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:01.240]   are leaking, so, I agree to this, and he shoots me up, and the nurse gets my chin up on this
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.960]   chin brace, and they bring this forward, and I'm really, I'm looking into two holes, that
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.860]   I find out are the camera, this is the camera, these two holes, and it happens to be a flash
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.980]   camera, and they're going, flash, flash, flash, flash, I'm pulling back, the nurse is pushing
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:19.460]   my head forward, I am in shock, she's holding my eyes open, my natural inclination is just
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:23.520]   shut down like this, I mean, it's horrible, it's like a torture, it's like a clockwork
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:28.420]   orange situation, and I pull back, finally, when they finish, I can't see anything but
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.720]   spots that Dr. Mendel is breezing off his gown, blowing in the non-existent wind as
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.580]   he heads off, taking shorthand, insanely to go develop the slides, you know, to figure
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.540]   out, the nurse is holding my hand, talking about some vacation she's going to take in
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:44.180]   the Bahamas, and I'm sitting there, waiting, and you know, just sitting in the chair, dilated
[00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:52.620]   and waiting, at last, Dr. Mendel comes back with the results, he's developed the slides
[00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:56.440]   very quickly, and he's got this pad, and he's coming toward me, and he goes right by me
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.940]   and goes to the telephone, and he calls Dr. Schechter, the optometrist that sent me over
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:05.400]   there, and Dr. Schechter isn't in, so instead, he begins to dictate on this machine, and
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.800]   he's got this pad, he goes, hello, Dr. Schechter, this is Dr. Mendel speaking, first of all,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:25.600]   I want to thank you for sending over your patient, Gary Spalding. Close inspection of
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.460]   the left macula shows that there is a distortion of the internal limiting membrane secondary
[00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.940]   to the posterior hyaloid face contraction, but the posterior hyaloid, which was attached
[00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:38.500]   to the optic nerve macula, and major vessels of the retina are retained, attached, and
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.740]   intact. I said, Dr. Mendel, over here, could you tell me what's wrong with my left eye,
[00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:47.820]   please? He turns his back on me and continues dictating, saying, with disillusion of the
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.680]   central vitreo gel, the envelope that the vitreo gel is in begins to shrink and distort
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:55.620]   the surface of the retina. A fluorescein angiogram has been done on the eye to determine the
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:03.000]   amount of vascular distortion. I was surprised to see that he has some minimal cystoid macula
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.560]   edema on the left eye, on the basis of that capillary incompetence from that distortion.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:18.300]   Thank you. Dr. Mendel, what is wrong with my eye? He turns to me and goes, basically
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:32.500]   Gary, basically, you have a macula pucker. See how she laughed? You see how she's laughing?
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:37.360]   My lawyer did the same thing when I told him what I had. He said, macula pucker, I knew
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:44.340]   a girl in high school named macula pucker, and she had syphilis. I said, what is a macula
[00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:48.480]   pucker? He says, well, what it is, is this. Your vitreo serum, the jelly in your eye,
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.440]   due to trauma, stress, age, we don't know, is broken down, liquefied, and it's pulled
[00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:57.540]   away from the macula, which is the center of your retina, which is responsible for all
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:02.960]   detail and sight. And now, this is not an uncommon thing that the vitreous humor should
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:13.480]   actually break down. In many autopsies, we find that, we find that people don't have
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.700]   that vitreous humor, but in your case, you're very unfortunate, because when it's pulling
[00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:22.120]   away, it left a little piece of edema or skin, a little tissue on that macula, and it's reacting
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:26.300]   to it by puckering. You just have to think of the macula there as a piece of saran wrap,
[00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:33.180]   you know, and it's puckering up. That's what it is. It's a pucker. You've got a pucker there.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.000]   But what could cause that? You say, I don't want it to happen to my right eye. What would
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.080]   have caused a thing like that? Well, I don't know. Did you have any traumas to your left
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.440]   eye? The last one I can remember was so long ago, I can't imagine. It was 1976, and I was
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.500]   dancing at this New Year's Eve party, and there was this woman dancing with me that
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:57.940]   she didn't have a very good sense of her own personal space, if you know what I mean. And
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.640]   her pinky went into my left eye and her fingernail scratched my cornea. It was awful. It was
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.440]   tearing. I had to have it patched. It was very painful. He just looks at me and goes,
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.920]   you have a good memory, don't you, Gary? I said, what can be done? Is there any remedy
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:20.600]   for the left eye? Yes, I recommend a little macula scraping. Now, as soon as I heard that
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:27.160]   word scraping, I wanted a second, third, and fourth opinion. And he said, don't bother.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.820]   I am the best macula scraper in the city. Now, up until then, I really didn't like the
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:36.240]   man. I thought he was really arrogant. Now I basically hated him. And I had no problems
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.560]   just walking out of the office. I usually have problems. I just strolled on out. And
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.500]   I went and I told Renee what he told me. And she immediately, and this is what Renee is
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:49.480]   great at, research energy. She gets so intent, she is going to find the best macula scraper
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.040]   in the United States, and she goes out and she begins researching. Now I, on the other
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:00.960]   hand, am more interested in kind of speculating on what the cause might be. I don't want it
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.080]   to happen in my right eye. And also, knowing the cause gives me, you know, some sort of
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.520]   satisfaction, the meaning, the understanding of what the logic behind this thing is. So
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.200]   I'm sitting down at my desk while Renee is doing the workshop, speculating on what could
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:17.040]   it be. The first thing I come up with, the book, the novel, Impossible Vacation. It was
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:22.120]   simply too painful. I was writing about my mother's suicide. I had not properly mourned
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:30.320]   her or grieved her. And here, what had happened, I just cried, one big tear. My eye exploded.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:33.080]   And then, no, no, no, I thought maybe it was not that. It was because I wrote the book
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:41.080]   in the first person, and it was just too much, "I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I." Then I
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.600]   thought, no, maybe it's my left brain rebelling against my right brain, or vice versa. Whenever
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.960]   I'd ask my friends, the New Age friends, you know, New Agers out on the West Coast, what
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   they thought was going on, they'd say, "Well, what is it you don't want to see?" And I had
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   lists. Then I began to speculate that it was my Oedipus complex because the book, the novel,
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.040]   was a lot about that. Not that I had ever been consciously aware of wanting to sleep
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:14.240]   with my mother, but at the time that I was working on the book, I was reading Freud's
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.760]   essay on negation. And Freud says, "The denial of some state of affairs is often implicit
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:26.600]   acknowledgement of it." You know the rest. So if some guy says that he never wanted to
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:32.000]   sleep with his mother, the chances are he gave it some solid consideration. I'm thinking
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.160]   the kind of, the thing that the repressed, the one that was giving it the solid consideration
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:43.880]   is now feeling guilty for it, is reaching up, scratching out my eye one at a time. Starting
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.800]   with the left and feminine eye. But basically this is the kind of thing that I'm working
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:57.440]   on while Renée is looking for doctors. And she comes up with a wonderful one at New York
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:02.160]   Hospital. And I go, I like him immediately, he's done a great job. This man is a Chinese,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:08.560]   beautiful kind of Buddha smile, nice bedside man, not like most eye doctors who are automatons.
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:13.600]   And he had, I like his language too, he didn't refer to it as mecha scraping, he referred
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:21.320]   to it as macula peeling. And he wanted to, and he also said please stop with this constant
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:27.120]   looking for causes, because I'll let you off the hook on that one. This condition is idiopathic,
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:32.280]   meaning no known cause, right? Idiopathic, no known cause, so let go of that. Now he
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.360]   also wants, he's very open about talking about the operation, wants to let me know about
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:43.960]   all the risks involved. It's a relatively new operation, it costs $10,000. It's not
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:52.120]   guaranteed to correct your sight, but chances are it could do a pretty good job. Let's see,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:56.360]   you'd have to cut into the eye with a knife, right? In two places, into my left eye. Make
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:02.600]   two incisions, and in one incision stick in the pump, the little pump to suck out what's
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:11.440]   left of the vitreous, then in the other, stick in this little peeler, to peel the macula.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:16.120]   And it's microsurgery, so they're dilating the pupil and the iris to put this microscope
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:22.960]   through, in order to see it. And he said that chances are, there's some chance of infection,
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:31.560]   he wants me to know that, which would mean prosthesis. A chance of, when he's peeling
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.860]   it, that he actually tears the retina, which would mean instant blindness in the left eye.
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:43.960]   And a 35% chance of cataract due to the trauma from the operation. Oh, and then there's a
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:56.880]   1% chance that it will simply go away on its own. And I'm banking on that. "But Mr. Gray,"
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:16:03.760]   he says, "We are not in a rush to operate." "Oh, really?" "No, we'll see how it deteriorates,
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.240]   we don't want you to check in with me every few months, and see if it holds its own, it's
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:13.520]   just not necessary to go at it right yet, it hasn't gone that far." And I said, "What
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:18.040]   do you mean this time, then, to like do alternatives?" "Well, I don't want to just wait, I mean, I
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:26.320]   could check out other ways of possibly treating it, like acupuncture or diet or prayer, or
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.880]   all three." "Oh, yes," he says, "Please," with his great Buddhist smile, "Try all the
[00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:44.400]   alternatives you want." "Then we'll have to operate." So I go back and tell Renée the
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:53.400]   prognosis and she says, "Paul, do you know what prosthesis means?" And I said, "Wait,
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:56.400]   now I thought I did, and you've got me on a spot here, I would say that I would know
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:00.920]   that word, it hasn't got to do with the prostate gland, does it?" "No, wait, doesn't it mean
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:09.280]   false arm or false leg?" She says, "Try eye. Try glass eye." "I didn't want to go into
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.960]   a hospital, she freaked me out, the doctor freaked me out if I could avoid it, God, a
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.880]   friend of mine went in not long ago and he was just a simple gallbladder operation and
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:20.260]   a nurse gave him a shot in the wrong quadrant of his buttock and hit his sciatic nerve and
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:25.020]   paralyzed his right leg, he's suing the hospital for a million dollars, God." Renée went in
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:29.480]   not long ago and she went in for an operation, it was a few years ago, and the day she went
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.640]   in there was a cover story in the New York Post about some disgruntled hospital worker,
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:38.840]   you know, that kind of person, been fired, disgruntled, look out for that, and it was
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:46.500]   the hospital she was in and he was going around putting horse tranquilizers in the IVs. Years
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.200]   ago before Renée and I knew each other, she was living in Boston, she was a dating OBGYN,
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.380]   and for her date she'd go to the hospital to meet him because he was always there delivering
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:58.720]   babies and he had this little cubicle with a bed in it, so it was a perfect place for
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:06.000]   a date. And he had access to liquid cocaine, and they would get in that bed and they would
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.280]   rub the liquid cocaine on their sexual organs and then they'd smoke a big joint and marijuana
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:18.600]   and go to town. And in the middle of this, his beeper would go off and he'd get up stoned
[00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:29.580]   with an erection and go off to deliver a baby. I didn't want to have to go into hospital,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:37.440]   I really didn't want to unless it was really necessary. Also, I'd grown up as a Christian
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:42.080]   scientist so I'd had very little experience with hospitals or doctors for that matter.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:46.840]   I mean, when we grew up as Christian scientists, we were told that all disease was an error.
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.920]   You see, it was called error, because error in our thinking, not God's thinking, our thinking.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.520]   We had to correct our thinking and then we would get better. If we didn't, we didn't
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.440]   get better. There was a lot of guilt involved there. I mean, as a child I didn't know what
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:01.120]   error meant. I didn't know it was a mistake in thinking. I thought error was just a little
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:05.960]   green man named error that came at you at night like little Peter Payne and ran up your
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.960]   arm with a pitchfork and stab, stab, stab your throat, you get a sore throat, that was
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:15.280]   error. Like when my carcass manual got hit by a car when I was a kid, not killed but
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:22.000]   wounded, it went error, error, error, error, error, error, error, error, error, error.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.280]   My mother said, "You see, Spuddy dear, even the dog knows." And it was a lonely situation
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.360]   growing up in Barrington, Rhode Island as a Christian scientist. I think there were
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:36.480]   only eight of us there, my brothers and I, two brothers down the street, they're parents,
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:40.520]   and we didn't even have a church. We went to church in Providence. So I can remember
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:43.680]   that my friends would just out of the clear blue occasionally do these, what I would call
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:50.200]   these little Protestant inquisitions. I remember being backed up against a big elm tree and
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:20:02.600]   him saying, "You don't believe in doctors, right?" "That's right." "Say lightning hit
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.160]   this tree branch here and it came down your head and hit your brains and your brains are
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:12.800]   drooling out all over the grass. Would you go to a doctor then?" "No." "Say you're walking
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.200]   across the street just now and a cement mixer came along and squished the whole lower part
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:23.600]   of your body right into the road. Would you go to a doctor then?" "No." "Say the North
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.560]   Koreans invaded Barrington, Rhode Island and took a cage of hungry rats, starving rats
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.400]   and put them up to your ass and they started eating up into your body. Would you go to
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.000]   a doctor then?" "No." So I began to think my friends had this death wish for me. I was
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.300]   very much on the outside, you see, of the community. Now, I didn't have a lot of healings,
[00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.600]   I guess, because I was basically, luckily, I was healthy as a kid. I can remember my
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:49.880]   first, I remember one when I was 12, I think I was 12 or 13 and I had this little, this
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.760]   is very embarrassing, this little like stalactite growing off the end of my nose, like a piece
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:00.780]   of flesh growing in the morning. I woke up and it was there one morning and kept growing
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.720]   and it was very embarrassing. It was more embarrassing than pimples then because my
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:09.040]   friends were always saying, "You got some snot on your nose." And I'd say, "It's not
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:19.520]   snot. It's not." So I wanted to have a cauterize, just burned off, I wanted to go right to the
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:25.480]   doctor, bypass prayer, just get it done, a quickie. And I went to my mother, I said,
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.800]   "Mom, please can I go to the doctor for this one?" "No, dear, we have to have the
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   practitioner pray for a little bit." What could I say? She had the car. So, she called
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.120]   the Christian Science Practitioner. He prayed, he was praying for the little thing to drop
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.280]   off. I was praying for the little thing to drop off and Mom was praying for the little
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.240]   thing to drop off. After a few days it didn't. She said, "Just give it till the end of
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.800]   the week." I said, "All right." At the end of the week I said, "Can I go to
[00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.360]   the doctor?" She said, "One more day." Well, I gave one more big day because that
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:56.160]   day, Monday, I was being tutored. I was failing seventh grade math, I remember, and I, my
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.800]   tutor was there, a nice woman, and she keeps looking at my nose. And finally she says,
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:07.580]   "Looks like you could use a hanky." And so I'm just humoring her by taking her
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:25.380]   little lace hanky and I wipe my nose and off it comes. So, keeping that healing in mind,
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:30.800]   I decided what I would do is try to revert back to Christian Science as my first alternative,
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.560]   which was a real surprise to me. And I had never called a practitioner before to do prayer
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.900]   work, my mother had always done that, and here I was, an adult and doing it on my own.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:43.240]   I was in London at the time, touring, and I was calling San Francisco, I had a recommendation
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:47.920]   there, and if that power of prayer goes around the world, it would be all right. And, uh,
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.340]   now when you call a Christian Science practitioner, you're told, "Do not mention the disease.
[00:22:52.340 --> 00:22:57.280]   Don't go into it because it gives it power." Just, you just refer to it as an error. So
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.620]   needless to say, there's a lot of innuendo going around that word error. [laughter]
[00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:08.820]   Is it a big error, as in cancer, or is it a little error, as in a cold or a medium error,
[00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:12.620]   as in the flu? So I just blooted right out. I said, "This is Spalding Gray calling long,
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:16.260]   this is from London, and I have this eye condition in my left eye that's known. I think I know
[00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:21.220]   just about enough, Mr. Gray. I don't think you have to go into it. I'm going to, if you're
[00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:25.980]   there, you can go to a Christian Science reading room and look up what Mary Baker Eddy says
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.800]   about the perfection of eyes and the science and health of the key to the scriptures, page
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:36.100]   624 and 625. And I think I can begin working with you from here, and we can get something
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.180]   done." I said, "Really?" "Yes, but there's one question I'd like to ask first before
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:50.960]   we begin. Are you faithful?" "You mean am I filled with faith, or?" "No." "Are you seeing
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:24:06.680]   anyone else? Any doctors?" "Well, it's this Chinese guy, but it's really not serious.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:15.980]   I mean, I don't, I mean, I drop in every few months." "Well, I don't think we can work
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.820]   together if you, we can't divide our faith like that. You have to make a decision between
[00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:26.920]   me and the doctor." "But he said I could see other people." "But I don't work that way,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:30.680]   so you, none of us work that way, you're going to have to understand that. Give it some thought
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.080]   and some consideration, it's been good talking with you, and call me back when you've made
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:42.940]   up your mind. God bless." And I hung up, and I knew right then why it was I had left Christian
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:25:00.200]   Science. So I went to my therapist. My therapist was a graduate from Auschwitz, so he was an
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:06.120]   existential realist. And I went in to talk about my eye problem, and he goes, "Spalding,
[00:25:06.120 --> 00:25:17.860]   Spalding, please, please, listen, all things are contingent, and there is also chaos. In
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:26.260]   other words, shit happens. Please give up this problem with the causes, and the thinking
[00:25:26.260 --> 00:25:36.180]   of why, and the where's, and the magical thinking, and the airy fairy, Disneyland, twinkle bell,
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:45.560]   will you do the right thing and get the operation?" So he was no help. And I left his office in
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:51.520]   despair. I was really out of it, and started just walking, doing my New York walking blues.
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.340]   Whenever I don't know what to do, I just walk the city, and I'm kind of ragged in an overcoat,
[00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.820]   haven't shaved for three days. I look kind of like I feel, and despairing, thinking,
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:26:04.660]   my God, what is going on here? How can I allow someone to cut my eye with a knife, cut into
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:10.580]   the window to my soul? And what is this business with detail? Why am I losing the detail, which
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:15.780]   is the most important thing to me? My stories are always about detail, about telling about
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.100]   detail, what I see. What if I lost my sight and my right eye? I mean, what would I do?
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:26.780]   I don't know any other way to live. I don't have a way to make a living. I mean, I'm not
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:30.920]   making up any of these things I'm telling you. I mean, I'd love to be able to make things
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:36.900]   up, then I could just make things up and not have to live them first, save a lot of wear
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:43.760]   and tear. A lot of wear and tear on my body. So as I'm walking, I'm thinking, what would
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:48.900]   I do if I ever lost my sight and my right eye? What would I do? Be a blind poet in New
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:52.720]   York City? I hate poetry. And I'm thinking these things. I'm walking. I find that I'm
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:56.900]   walking in the Bowery all of a sudden, and this is fine. It fits my mood. I'm passing
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:02.100]   through a gaggle, a crowd, a bunch of prostitutes that are working out of cars, no hotel. I
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:08.140]   just go around the corner in a car and come back. And they're all headed for a car that's
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:12.580]   pulling up. I see out of the corner of my good eye a black Pontiac. And they're rushing
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:20.700]   over to it like a bunch of prostitutes. They're all leaning on the window. I don't pay any
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:26.460]   attention to it. I'm into my own problems. And one of them yells over, "Yo, boy, hey!
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:41.180]   They want you!" And I turn, because I'm curious. And I love to be wanted. And I go over, and
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:46.940]   the prostitutes part like the Red Sea. And I walk over, and there's this 1970 black Pontiac,
[00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:51.460]   four-door Pontiac, with three Hasidic shoes in it, two in the front and one in the back.
[00:27:51.460 --> 00:28:06.800]   And they say, "Get in." And I do. Because I'm curious. Look, I was sure they were Hasidic
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.020]   shoes. I thought I was pretty safe there. I mean, I can't imagine anyone being able
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:16.540]   to impersonate a Hasidic Jew. I mean, if there were three priests in the car, I would not
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:26.820]   have gotten in. So I get in the back with the youngest guy, and there's no sexual vibe
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:30.140]   in there at all. I don't know what they want. They close the door. We're off. The prostitutes
[00:28:30.140 --> 00:28:36.220]   are yelling, "Bye! Have a good trick!" And we're pouring off down the bar. And I say,
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:44.420]   "Where are you taking me?" And they say, "Williamsburg." I said, "Why not? I've never been. It's an
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:49.860]   interesting tour. I mean, why not go with the chosen people?" And by now I was calling
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:54.620]   myself Peter, and I said I was a drifter from Schenectady. I was trying to get a vacation
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:58.060]   from Spaulding Gray. I'm thinking, "Peter with perfect eyes." That's what I was thinking.
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:03.500]   "Peter with the perfect eyes." I have no idea what we're doing. We head for the Williamsburg
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:06.860]   Bridge, but before they go over the bridge, they want to stop and buy pizza and beer for
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:10.580]   me. I said, "Oh, no, thanks. I just ate, and I don't drink before five. Don't bother." So
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:16.420]   we go over the bridge, and we pull up in front of this small synagogue in Williamsburg, and
[00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.800]   they get out, and I just follow them right into it. And we go in, and there's a number
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:23.980]   of hostilities. They're fixing bindings on books and looking up and winking at me like
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:28.980]   little Santa Clauses. And they take me to the back kitchen, in the kitchen area, to
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:37.180]   the back door, and the driver of the car hands me a rake and a shovel and a dustpan and a
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:44.780]   couple of garbage bags. Opens the back door and points out to the backyard and goes, "Please,
[00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:53.200]   clean." Now, I knew at any point I could just say I was Spaulding Gray, drop everything
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:57.300]   and run, but I wasn't. I wasn't doing that. I was still Peter, and I got out there with
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:03.340]   a rake, and I started to do it. I amazed myself how I had so much energy in that rake. Oh,
[00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.800]   that felt good. I hadn't done anything like that in years, all those wet leaves coming
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:12.220]   up and broken plastic, white plastic knives and forks and leftover paper plates and cups
[00:30:12.220 --> 00:30:15.780]   from parties they'd had. I'm doing such a good job. A woman that lives in the back raises
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:19.660]   her window and says, "Hey, boy, you work good. You come here next? How much you charge?"
[00:30:19.660 --> 00:30:25.180]   I said, "No, I'm all booked up for the day. Sorry." And I'm raking up, and about an hour
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:28.940]   goes by, and I'm just putting the piles of leaves into the garbage bags, and the driver
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:36.300]   head guy comes down and looks around, nods and goes, "Very good. You are the hardest
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:44.300]   working Bowery bum we've ever picked up, but you see when we bring them over here, they
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:50.460]   work for drinks only, and you don't seem to be drinking, so I suppose we must pay you
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:31:05.300]   something then." I suppose so. Eight dollars, I think. No, no, 10. I go $10 an hour. Eight
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:11.900]   plus coffee. No, 10 and I'll walk. No. So here it is, a Scott and a Chew haggling it
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:18.800]   out in the backyard of a synagogue. I get the $10 and I walk, and I walk across the
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.820]   Brooklyn Bridge, and I feel triumphant. I think, "My God, there is something I can do
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:33.980]   if I lose my sight in my right eye." Shortly after this incident, there was a storytelling
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:38.360]   reunion for the people at the Upstate Workshop, and it was in New York City. I wasn't going
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:44.820]   to go, but I went because I was hoping I would run into a Zaria Thornbird, and she lived
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:50.200]   in Minneapolis. I was doubted that she'd come that distance, but she did, and I was happy
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:56.000]   to see her. I really wasn't looking at her. I was kind of looking down. Just couldn't
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.380]   quite look at her right away. How to describe this woman? Every night I find it difficult
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:09.220]   to get words around her. She's kind of really a mysterious... The facts are she lives outside
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:13.560]   of Minneapolis. She's a single mother of two boys. I think they're 9 and 11 now. Seems
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:17.600]   to be a good mother. The kids are in great shape, pretty normal, but she trained with
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:24.760]   one of the most controversial sorcerers named Everett K. White Owl. He's part Welsh and
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.920]   he's part American Indian. He trains these people in these American Indian ways, or his
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:36.600]   version of them, in the desert outside of LA, in what I refer to as Manson country.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:41.760]   She did all these workshops where she turned to things like lucid dreaming, astral projection,
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:47.000]   the breath of fire, the Indian breath of fire, which she teaches out in Minneapolis. And then
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.300]   she couldn't fly out anymore to do the workshop, so she started meeting her sorcerer in her
[00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:54.440]   lucid dream states. Now here's the thing that she described to me. I haven't seen this so
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:58.360]   I don't know if this really happens, but what she says is she goes to bed and then in the
[00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:02.440]   night she has two bodies evidently. There's a dream, there's an astral body that rises
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   up out of her corporal body and wanders around the house in this lucid dream state meeting
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:12.400]   various Indian grandmothers. And then she finally meets her sorcerer, Everett K., in
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:18.960]   his astral body. They do a workshop to save airfare. They do it and then they finish it
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:25.160]   and his astral body zips back to the desert faster than American Airlines. And her astral
[00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:31.100]   body goes back into her corporal body and she wakes up in one body. I said, "I'm sorry,
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.760]   you mean to say that you have a body that comes up out of your body and looks back at
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:40.100]   this other body and you've never tried to make love to yourself?" I mean, that's the
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:45.840]   first thing I would do before I went looking for Indian grandmothers. I mean, I'd satisfy
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.920]   myself first. She said she'd never thought of it, but she gave it a try, she said and
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:59.720]   it worked. So she is very open. Also, she does this breath of fire which she teaches
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.640]   to women out in the Minneapolis area. And this breath of fire, she showed it to me.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:08.960]   It's incredible. She lay in front of me and she came like a Reichean dream from her toes
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   to her nose eight times without touching herself once. Her whole body just, "Oh, oh." I said,
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:22.560]   "Teach me, teach me, teach me. Do you know how many nights I spend in lonely hotels and
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.760]   motels across America? If I could come like that without touching myself, I'd be a happy
[00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:34.880]   man or at least content." So she gets me down on the ground and says, "You have to suck
[00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:39.600]   in the energy through your coccyx or the base of your spine." Energy, first of all, I don't
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.800]   know what she's talking about, but I'm trying to imagine energy. And I'm trying to suck
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:35:02.080]   and I'm just like... All I can get is a sensation that was similar to reverse farting. All I'm
[00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:08.920]   trying to say is she is an unusual woman. And she showed up at the workshop and I'm
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:13.840]   talking to her about my eye. "Oh God," I'm saying, "I don't want to go in a hospital. I just don't
[00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:18.120]   want to." And she's, "Spaulding by no means should you have that operation. Please don't
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:22.640]   enter a hospital." "Well, I won't. I mean, I'll try not to. I'm trying to do some alternative
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.880]   therapies right now and the doctor's giving me some time." "Well, I'll tell you the one
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:32.220]   that you must do." "What?" "Look at me now." "Just a minute now." "No, tell me. You come.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.960]   You must do the Indian prayer meeting. We would do the sweat lodge out in Minneapolis
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:41.040]   because this power, the power of group prayer when you're in with a number of people and
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.840]   everyone's working together to raise that energy, you must come out and do a sweat lodge
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.040]   with us. You do it and you'll find that you may have a healing that you wouldn't expect.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:53.480]   Now, look me in the eyes and tell me you'll do it." "I'll come. I promise. No, just look
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.800]   me in the face, Spaulding, and tell me you'll come." And I look her... And her face begins
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:02.340]   to drool down off of her scalp. And I go, "Stop it. Whatever you're doing and however
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:08.620]   you do that, stop it. I'll come." So I promise that I'll come out but I don't, I don't, you
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:13.360]   know. I kind of put it off and Renee tries to, you know, well, actually she's not too
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.240]   keen on the idea. This is the one alternative therapy that she thinks, you know, she's trying
[00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:23.600]   to stop me from going out there. So at last I get out there and it's winter. Good time
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:29.140]   to sweat in Minneapolis and I... As we go out to the flat lands outside of Minneapolis
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:34.640]   and she does this big ceremony where she has a peace pipe, an Indian peace pipe, calls
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:39.480]   the spirits from the four directions, then we all follow her out in the deep snow and
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.120]   we get out in the snow and the sweat lodge is out there, been built, you know, out of
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.800]   saplings tied together, the Indian traditional way, it's a dome. The Indians would have animal
[00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:53.520]   skins over it and they had plastic in canvas to keep the steam in. And then, oh, the hot
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:59.140]   rocks, the fire keeper started the pit going and the hot rocks had been just, since morning,
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:04.100]   the rocks were glowing. And then we're standing in the snow and she says, all right, everyone,
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.240]   just take off your clothes and throw them in the snow. Everyone's doing what she says.
[00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:11.300]   It's amazing. It's freezing out there. We take off our clothes and throw them in the
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:16.540]   snow. And then I rush to line up to get in the tent. It's about 17 people. And I get
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.720]   to now, we're like these freezing refugees, naked in the snow. And I'm looking around.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:23.800]   I noticed there aren't any Native American Indians there, that's for sure. Mainly they're
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:28.400]   people of Swedish derivation, I'd say. Blond hair, blue eyes, and we're all lined up and
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:33.640]   quaking in the snow. And Azaria says, before you enter the tent, you have to cry out to
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:40.040]   the sky, all my ancestors, don't we do that? I do what I'm told. And the first person goes,
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:44.560]   all my ancestors, in it goes, in, all my ancestors, in, all my ancestors, in. It gets to me, I
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:51.240]   go, all my ancestors. And I go, wait a minute, all my ancestors, and I'm like, who are they?
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.420]   Because my father had just finished the family tree and I had gone over it. And I remember
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:38:00.720]   names like John Proctor, the right Reverend Curtis Fox Gray and his wife, thankful Atherton
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:08.840]   Gray, Colonel Simeon Spaulding, Captain Edward Spaulding, Brigadier General John Crane, the
[00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:18.120]   only man wounded at the Boston Tea Party. And I think, all my ancestors, who were they?
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.120]   Pilgrims. What did they do shortly after they came to America? Kill the Indians. Where was
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:31.200]   I going? An Indian sweat lodge. Good luck. So we get inside, it's quite dark. The snow,
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:34.480]   it's not hot at all, there's no rocks in there yet, so it's damn cold and we're sitting on
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.320]   hay on top of the snow and about, all men and women, naked, sitting in a circle, and
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:44.080]   Azaria gives the, tell us what's going to happen. It's going to be four rounds of prayer.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:48.160]   The first round of prayer will be to pray for an attitude or intention that you want
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.600]   to maintain throughout the whole ceremony, which could be quite long, could be up to
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:57.320]   three hours, they tell me, I can't believe it. And then, then second round is you pray
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:39:02.920]   for friends and loved ones. The third round you pray to give something away that you don't
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:10.080]   want anymore, like a giveaway, like say, an eye condition. But Azaria points out it's
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.720]   very important that you don't take on someone's giveaway. Don't identify with it, please,
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.620]   or you're going to really get quite ill. This is going to be a mess. So just let it pass
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.360]   right through you and out of the tent. The fourth round is that we just, Azaria is going
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:29.940]   to pour some cold water over the hot rocks and we just sit and listen to them steam.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:35.640]   And she said that they, they sometimes talk and give you valuable information. That's
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:39.680]   round four. And that's it. And so we begin, and the way that we're supposed to pray is
[00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:46.000]   to say, oh great spirit, my name is, then you say your prayer and then you say, I have
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.840]   spoken to indicate when it's time for the next person to go on that you've finished.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:53.480]   So fine, I like all this ritual and it's pretty clear to me. And the first hot rocks are brought
[00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:59.200]   in by the fire keeper and put in a pit. And Azaria pours some cold water and, whoa, wow,
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:04.520]   steam comes ripping across my face and I suddenly get a sense of la, la, la. I know what they
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.460]   mean by steam. You know, I know the hot, whoa, it could get hot in there. I didn't realize
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:12.620]   up until then. And they slowly begin to go around to pray for intentions. And it starts
[00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:20.140]   with, oh great spirit, my name is Shelly and I pray that I can maintain a thankful, prayerful
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:27.900]   attitude throughout this ceremony. I have spoken. Oh great spirit, my name is Robert
[00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.660]   and I pray that I can be humbled throughout this ceremony. I have spoken. It comes round
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:39.520]   to me and I say, oh great spirit, this is Spaulding speaking and I pray that I can maintain
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:44.860]   an open and sincere attitude and not pollute this ceremony with my heady analysis and ironic
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:56.000]   commentary and end up turning this sacred event into just another story I will try to
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.640]   sell to the American public. I have spoken. And everyone in the tent goes, ho, ho, ho,
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:08.340]   ho, ho, which is a kind of cheerleading support cry for saying, let's see if you can pull
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:15.860]   that one off. More hot rocks are brought in. Wow, she pours more, oh God, whoa, get that
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:19.700]   steam away from me. I can barely see across the tent. It's getting very, very hot, very
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.340]   fast in there and really frightening and very claustrophobic. And we're going around too
[00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:28.580]   praying for friends and loved ones and I pray for Renee and I pray that she'll be able
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:34.300]   to get assigned a film script right in Hollywood that will be both intelligent, entertaining
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:43.300]   and get made and not have to star Macaulay Culkin. And I pray for friends with AIDS.
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:49.120]   More hot rocks are brought in. Whoa, I'm down on my side. People are groaning. I'm
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.340]   down on my side now trying to breathe some air in where the tent hits the ground. I can't
[00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.220]   get any fresh air in at all. My pulse is going boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. And all
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:01.500]   I can see is the sign on my health club, steam bath on my health club saying, do not exceed
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:07.260]   15 minutes under any circumstances. And I'm thinking, who is this Azaria Thorne bird anyway?
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:10.260]   I mean, so her head turned into a ball of white light. Does that mean she wouldn't
[00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:14.620]   try to kill me? I don't know how long I've been in there. Two and a half hours, two hours,
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:19.080]   two hours. More hot, more steam is coming at us. It's time for the giveaway. I'm hoping
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:23.920]   get to me quickly. My pulse is going to explode. I got my hand on it. Boom, boom, boom, boom,
[00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.820]   boom, boom, boom. People are slowly going around. Oh, great spirit, this is Shelly speaking
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.860]   and I want to give away my pride. I have spoken. Oh, great spirit, this is Robin speaking.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:35.020]   I want to give away my greed. I have spoken. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:38.660]   Oh, great spirit, this is Tara and I want to give away my craving for caffeine. I have
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:43.220]   spoken. It comes around to me. I say, oh, great spirit, this is Spalding speaking and
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:48.860]   I want to give away the fear that I'm about to have a heart attack at this very moment.
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:54.120]   And just as I say that, the guy next to me runs out the tent screaming, my heart is popping,
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   my heart is popping, my heart is popping and I'm fine. My pulse goes back to normal. He
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:11.680]   just took all my fear and ran right out the door with it. Azaria says, someone has broken
[00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.820]   the sacred circle. The power has gone out of the ceremony. Please, we must not that
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.820]   happen again for this, the last round. We are going to sit here and listen to the hot
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:25.540]   rocks talk. Now, if someone feels they have to go, they must go now, but they cannot do
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:30.120]   it during the ceremony. Do you hear me? Now, I am both very claustrophobic and find it
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:36.060]   difficult to take orders. But I am sitting cross-legged determined to make it through
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:49.980]   this ceremony. I just hope the hot rocks don't talk too long. And it, she says, are you ready?
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:56.820]   I am closing the tent flap. And just as she closes that tent flap, this guy from her group
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:44:02.860]   with a ponytail down to his ass, leaps up and runs for the tent door. And she just throws
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:07.880]   her naked body in front of him and says, get back, lame deer. Get back. He hurls himself
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:13.380]   back on the hay going, shit, fuck, fuck, fuck, shit. And everyone's going, ho, ho, ho, ho,
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:18.660]   ho, ho, ho. They're holding him. They're hoeing him. They're hoeing him down. Ho, ho, ho,
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:34.740]   ho, ho, ho, ho. And we all sit there and listen to the hot rock steam. And I didn't understand
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:40.820]   a word. But I walk out of that tent feeling triumphant. I'm telling you to have made it
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:45.380]   through that, that, that sweat. I mean, I just, and it was beautiful. I don't know how
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.740]   long I've been. Two and a half hours, three hours. The sun was setting, casting rivers
[00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:52.900]   of red across crusty white snow. I could have rolled in that snow, my naked body giving
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:58.060]   off like an internal sun inside. And that felt great. And Azaria comes over to me and
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:02.740]   says, Spalding, what is wrong with you? I said, what do you mean what's wrong? I feel
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:08.020]   great. No. When the time came for you to give away your eye condition, you started babbling
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:18.980]   about a heart attack. Oh, shit. Oh, fuck. Oh, oh, oh, no. And I realized I was still
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:39.820]   the child who had to act on his most immediate fears. I got back to New York City. I was
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:44.780]   pretty depressed. I was sitting at the kitchen table talking to Renee, telling her about
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:50.140]   the sweat ceremony. I couldn't get the vision of Azaria throwing her naked body in front
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:56.020]   of lame deer. And I couldn't stop telling Renee about it over and over again. Her leg
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:46:03.360]   began to pump onto the table. She said, you know, Spald, if you're planning on hanging
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:09.820]   out with women that teach you how to cum eight times without touching yourself and hurl themselves
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:16.540]   in front of men trying to save themselves from being steamed to death, if you plan on
[00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:25.340]   doing that a lot more, I think that we should get married. Married? Kidding. Really? Yes.
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:32.580]   It has been 12 years. Why don't you want to? I don't know. I've always liked boyfriend
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:39.820]   and girlfriend. It's so young, you know, and I like boy, girl. Husband and wife is so formal.
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:46.900]   It's so biblical. But you don't want to be an old boy, do you? You're 50. I don't want
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:51.720]   to be an old girl. Now, what is it that upsets you about? I mean, what do you think about
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:59.540]   when you think about marriage? Divorce. And also the ceremony, the whole thing, the finality
[00:46:59.540 --> 00:47:12.420]   of it, you know, for as long as these couples shall live and wedlock. And till death do
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:16.160]   us part. Death? Death? Who wants to talk about being in a ceremony about death? It reminds
[00:47:16.160 --> 00:47:22.940]   me of your mortality and my eye. Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, actually, eye. My eye.
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:26.840]   How could I get married with this eye condition? I've got to clear that up first. I've got
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.380]   to focus on that. Now look, as soon as the eye is taken care of, then we'll talk like
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:35.220]   two adults about marriage. We have something to look forward to. And also, I was trying
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.800]   to listen to Gary Noll in the background, so I couldn't pay attention to Rene. If you
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.520]   don't know who Gary Noll is, he's the most radical nutritionalist in America. He really
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:50.640]   sleeps two hours a night and lives on air, you know, when he can find it. And I go up
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:54.820]   to the Whole Foods, the health food store on Prince Street and buy my organic food to
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:59.180]   eat while listening to Gary, and I can't eat a thing. I just get nauseous because according
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:05.780]   to Gary, everything gives you cancer, you know, and everything else cures you from it,
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:10.020]   cures you of it, you know. Now Rene had a brilliant idea while we were listening to
[00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.980]   the show, a light bulb idea. She said, "Why not, after the show, you call him and see
[00:48:13.980 --> 00:48:18.860]   if he has any information on what your condition is?" And so I do it, and he's really open.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:24.060]   He answers the phone, and he knows what a macular pucker is, and he asks me if I have
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:33.900]   ever heard of Dr. Ron A. Axe in Notley, New Jersey. No, I hadn't. Well, I should have
[00:48:33.900 --> 00:48:47.260]   because he's one of the top nutritional ophthalmologists in America. So he gives me the telephone number,
[00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:51.660]   right? He gives me the telephone number, and I call, and I call out there, and I have to
[00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:58.900]   tell you, I get the receptionist that's the oldest voice. I mean, I can't tell if it's
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:04.940]   a woman or a man. It's like Tiresias. It's like androgynous, old, ancient. How a doctor
[00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:15.140]   could have a voice that old answering a telephone is strange enough. "Hello? The what? You want
[00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:22.620]   to see Dr. Axe? Well, he's very busy. Yes, you can take your chances. Well, if you want
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.060]   to come out, you'd have to just come out very early and take your chances because you have
[00:49:26.060 --> 00:49:32.460]   to get out to fill out the dietary questionnaire. Now, if you're taking the bus, I am, you take
[00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:38.260]   the Port Authority straight out to the Notley Mall, then get out, turn left on Face Street,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:45.060]   follow it on down. You can't miss us. All right." No address, no nothing. I mean, but
[00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:53.740]   I think, you know, it sounds like an important journey, and I should do what the old voice
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:59.660]   said. So I take the bus out to the Notley Mall, and I turn left down Face Street, and
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:07.320]   I see nothing. It's a desert, a wasteland. It's New Jersey. It's a row houses, track
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:12.860]   houses with high tension wires, no landscaping. And I'm walking. I don't see anything that
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:19.580]   is around the corner, and boom, there it is. Whoa. Like Hansel and Gretel's house on acid.
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:26.340]   It's like, whoo, Froot Loops. Like a Howard Finster dream. Look at this house. I can't
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:30.080]   believe it. The shingles are painted, the colors of the rainbow. There's day-glo outlines
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:35.940]   around the windows. The rocks are the foundation that the house is on. Yellow, green, blue,
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:40.260]   and these fir trees are there with this sign on it that says, "Dr. Ron A. Axe," and then
[00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:53.100]   there's initials. O-D-F-F-A-O-F-C-O-U-D-F-I-C-A-F-A-S-S. And out of the pine trees are coming this friendly
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:58.200]   little elfin guy that can't weigh more than 97 pounds with these bottle-thick glasses.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:06.340]   I hope it's not Dr. Ron A. Axe. No, it's Don B. Axe, his brother and assistant. And he
[00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:10.280]   leads me around to the sun porch. Come, come, come. Come follow me, please. And we go around
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:13.780]   to this sun porch and go into the back of the house, and I walk in. I'm overwhelmed.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:19.320]   Quarterphonic opera is playing, Madame Butterfly, full blast. Ski medals are all over the walls.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.920]   Over in the corner is a prehistoric landscape with little miniature dinosaurs playing in
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:28.020]   it. A six-foot cutout of Hoagy Carmichael is standing next to me over here. On the ceiling
[00:51:28.020 --> 00:51:35.060]   is a four-foot wide map of the moon framed in a pink hula hoop. The toothless head of
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:40.220]   a Bengal tiger is roaring over there at me. Pouring down the wall is a yellowing teletape
[00:51:40.220 --> 00:51:45.180]   printout of Lyndon Johnson's 1964 speech accepting the Democratic nomination. Pouring down the
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:50.180]   wall, and I'm like this, you know, and Don is going, "All this stuff makes you want to
[00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.680]   see, doesn't it? Makes you want to look around the room. Activates your eyes, doesn't it?
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:59.700]   Everybody makes it, I want to look.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:06.300]   So Don gets out the dietary questionnaire, here it is.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:12.540]   It's 742 questions concerning everything I've eaten for the past six months.
[00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:17.540]   It's got the categories soups, meats, poultry, fish, seafood, dairy products, vegetables,
[00:52:17.540 --> 00:52:22.700]   desserts, sweets, beverages, grains, breads, cereals, nuts, seeds, fruits, spices, herbs,
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:36.780]   ingredients, miscellaneous items, and he begins with burrito.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:39.980]   Now I have a pretty good memory, and I can picture all the Mexican restaurants flying
[00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:43.280]   at me like in a dream, but I can't remember what's on the plate.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.540]   Is it a taco?
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:49.540]   Is it an enchilada?
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:55.380]   I say burrito's like a little white football kind of thing, isn't it?
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.920]   How many burritos?
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:59.300]   Oh, 18.
[00:52:59.300 --> 00:53:05.220]   All right, 18 burritos.
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.700]   With a whole wheat or flour?
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.460]   I say, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:10.460]   Whole wheat burritos?
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:12.820]   I don't travel in those circles.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:17.420]   18, all right, 18 flour, 18 flour.
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   How many borscht?
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.420]   Borscht?
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:20.420]   I rarely run into borscht, no.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:22.820]   Now wait a minute, here's the confusing thing.
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.200]   When you say in six months, five months ago I happened to be in Russia and I had borscht
[00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:28.340]   every day, but I wouldn't normally have it.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:29.340]   How many days?
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.340]   Well, I think I was there 14 days.
[00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:31.940]   All right, we'll put down 16 just to be safe.
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:32.940]   You might have had some for breakfast.
[00:53:32.940 --> 00:53:33.940]   All right?
[00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:34.940]   All right, you're done.
[00:53:34.940 --> 00:53:35.940]   Hot dogs, hot dogs, hot dogs.
[00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:36.940]   No hot dogs.
[00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:37.940]   No, I don't eat them.
[00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:38.940]   You forget.
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:39.940]   Well, wait a minute now.
[00:53:39.940 --> 00:53:42.540]   Now there are exceptions here because I was in Columbus, Ohio four months ago, and right
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:44.860]   across from my hotel was a place called Coney Island.
[00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:45.860]   You could go.
[00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:46.860]   I went in there every day.
[00:53:46.860 --> 00:53:47.860]   Oh, no, wait a minute.
[00:53:47.860 --> 00:53:53.220]   It's a W. And in the middle of this, the old voice comes into the room that I heard on
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.220]   the phone.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:59.740]   It's his 87-year-old mother with a babushka on and bottle-thick glasses just going, "All
[00:53:59.740 --> 00:54:00.900]   right, all right, all right.
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:03.300]   Time to bring Mr. Gray in to see Dr. Axe."
[00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:05.780]   "Mother, please, we have not finished the dietary questionnaire."
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.460]   "Bring him into the antechamber then.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.460]   Bring him into the antechamber.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.460]   We'll finish it there."
[00:54:09.460 --> 00:54:12.220]   There's an antechamber further in, another room.
[00:54:12.220 --> 00:54:13.220]   We go in.
[00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:14.620]   Quadraphonic opera is playing there.
[00:54:14.620 --> 00:54:16.540]   On the wall is mounted the box.
[00:54:16.540 --> 00:54:19.860]   The box seat of the head, of the manager of the Metropolitan Opera.
[00:54:19.860 --> 00:54:23.980]   He's drawn his son, or sang for the Met, and then saved it.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:28.700]   And in it are cutouts, six-foot cutouts, black and white, of Toscanini and Caruso.
[00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:33.420]   And underneath, cross sabers, miniature Valkyries, on the ceiling, a map of the universe with
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:38.060]   Christmas balls hanging down on strings at various lengths.
[00:54:38.060 --> 00:54:40.760]   And I am like, "Oh, ew."
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:41.760]   And he's going, "Rabbit.
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:42.760]   How many?
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   Rabbit.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   We're up to rabbit now.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:46.720]   Do you need it with the skin, or skin off?
[00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:49.140]   No, Renee doesn't let rabbit in the house.
[00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:50.140]   "Bring him in, please.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:51.140]   It's time.
[00:54:51.140 --> 00:54:53.140]   You can finish the dietary questionnaire later.
[00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.100]   Bring him in to the doctor, Dr. Axe, please."
[00:54:55.100 --> 00:54:57.100]   And the door opens.
[00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.220]   And there he is, sitting behind the desk, these spindly little men, and they couldn't
[00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:03.580]   weigh more than 100 pounds, looks very much like his brother, with these bottle-thick
[00:55:03.580 --> 00:55:05.220]   glasses on.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:15.320]   And this sign, this says, "Dr. Ron A. Axe, O.D., F.F.A.O., F.C.O.U.D., F.I.C.A., F.A.S.S."
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:19.600]   "Welcome, Mr. Gray, welcome.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.240]   Would you please get in the electric chair?"
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:27.280]   He calls his examination chair the electric chair, for some reason, it's a blue chair,
[00:55:27.280 --> 00:55:33.260]   I get in it, and I'm looking across the room at what is a screen, and he begins to project
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:41.880]   on this screen what I could only call a family slideshow.
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:47.760]   The first slide is of he and his brother skiing down Tuckerman's Ravine in Mount Washington.
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:52.960]   The next one is he and his brother and his 87-year-old mother skiing in Stowe, Vermont.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.160]   The next slide comes up.
[00:55:54.160 --> 00:55:58.000]   It's he and his brother's 87-year-old mother at Lennon's Tomb.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:01.340]   And I'm trying to relate, going, "Oh, I was there myself just five months ago.
[00:56:01.340 --> 00:56:02.880]   That's where I had the 16 borscht, you know?
[00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.960]   I'm trying to make sense of it.
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:09.040]   But I'm just going along with it."
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:13.360]   And up into this slide, I don't know how he does it, fades up into the left-hand corner
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:16.800]   of the slide, is a traditional eye chart.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:22.000]   And yet you see the slide, and he says, "Can you read it?"
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.100]   And I find that I can read it better than my Chinese doctor's office.
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:31.280]   Maybe I'm more relaxed in the slideshow, I don't know what it is.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:36.680]   But I think this method in this man's Michigas, you know, I'm going to let him examine my
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:37.680]   pucker.
[00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:40.440]   And he really wants to do that, right?
[00:56:40.440 --> 00:56:45.280]   So he's very enthusiastic, and he examines both eyes, and then he says, "Now I'm going
[00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.840]   to speculate."
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.360]   Just speculate a little bit about causes.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:49.360]   Causes?
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:51.520]   Oh, wow, this is interesting.
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.320]   I like this, I think.
[00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:57.880]   Vitamin C. Vitamin C. Do you take a lot of vitamin C?
[00:56:57.880 --> 00:56:59.760]   Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:04.120]   Because of my occupation, I can't afford to get a sore throat or a cold, I have no understudy.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:07.200]   I eat enormous amounts of it, particularly in the winter.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.080]   Do you know what vitamin C is?
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:13.600]   Well, wait a minute, I thought it was vitamin C.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:22.760]   No, it's ascorbic acid.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:26.240]   And did you know that the vitreous humor and the pancreas are two places in the body that
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:30.400]   cannot pass it on and pass it out of the body?
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.480]   So it holds on to it, and it's probably just rotting, rotting in your eye.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.160]   I mean, why would you pour acid into your eye?
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:42.160]   Now, if it isn't vitamin C, I would speculate that it might be a breakdown of the ozone
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.160]   layer.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.880]   You know, the sheep are going blind in New Zealand.
[00:57:44.880 --> 00:57:47.560]   And I hope you have a broad-brained hat, and you're wearing it, and I hope you have sunglasses
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:49.480]   that are treated well for ultraviolet light.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:50.920]   Now, this is just speculation.
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.560]   I want to have full blood workup to find out the elements and impurities that are in your
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.840]   system as well as a full 24-hour urine test.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:00.640]   You can take this chart, and you take it and have it worked up at a laboratory and bring
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.160]   it back to me, and we'll have a consultation.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:05.880]   You pay my mother $240, please, for today.
[00:58:05.880 --> 00:58:09.460]   So I go and pay the mother $240.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:13.880]   No health insurance in that place.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:16.640]   She's sitting there complaining, saying, "Work, work, work.
[00:58:16.640 --> 00:58:18.280]   That's all my son does now.
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   He researches.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:20.280]   He doesn't sleep.
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.280]   We don't have any fun anymore.
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:23.280]   I don't have a life.
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:26.120]   I used to ski.
[00:58:26.120 --> 00:58:33.680]   I'm 87 years old, I don't have a life."
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:40.360]   So I take this form that I'm supposed to have done, this blood workup, to various laboratories.
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:43.000]   Some in New York City, one in San Francisco.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:58.920]   Every place that looks at it goes, "We don't test human beings for these things."
[00:58:58.920 --> 00:59:03.120]   So I call Dr. Axe and tell him that I can't find a lab to do it, so he recommends one
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.120]   for me.
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:07.160]   I don't know if they're in cahoots, but it's up in Monroe, New York.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:09.080]   And I go up there, and they take the blood.
[00:59:09.080 --> 00:59:13.720]   They take a lot of blood, and it's $1,000, no insurance for this.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:16.060]   And they have more blood drawn out of me than I've ever had before.
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:21.160]   And also, they give me a carton to have to collect 24 hours worth of urine.
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:26.080]   So it's a big cardboard milk carton with a handle.
[00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:27.080]   And I'm carrying it everywhere.
[00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:30.680]   I'm ducking behind bushes in Central Park.
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:32.120]   I'm going to therapy with it.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.360]   I'm sitting in the theater with it between my legs there, riding on the subway with it
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:45.120]   between my legs, having made the mistake of eating asparagus the day before.
[00:59:45.120 --> 00:59:48.360]   So I get in, and I get the whole thing completed.
[00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:49.640]   I have to come in for the consultation.
[00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:51.280]   And he's very passionate and excited.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:52.520]   This is what I like about him, actually.
[00:59:52.520 --> 00:59:54.480]   He really is strange but passionate.
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.960]   And he's looking over the chart like this, and he goes, "Ha, all right, got it."
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.400]   Vanadium is the culprit.
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.920]   Vanadium goes right off the chart.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.080]   I said, "Vanadium?
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:04.080]   What is vanadium?"
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:07.240]   A rare element used to toughen steel and make it more shock-resistant.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:13.000]   In short, you're filled with heavy metal.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.320]   "Well, where would it come from?
[01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.120]   Where would I come into it?"
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.600]   Sea cucumbers and sea anemones.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.600]   Sea cucumbers.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:21.600]   I don't know anything about them.
[01:00:21.600 --> 01:00:22.600]   I've never seen a sea cucumber.
[01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:26.080]   But I'll bet you eat big fish, don't you?
[01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:27.600]   I'll bet you're a fan of big fish.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:28.960]   "Yes, I am.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:31.400]   I love big fish.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:33.640]   Probably every other day or every day if I could."
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:35.440]   Well, that's where the vanadium comes from.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.040]   That big fish, the sea cucumbers, the sea anemones, and then they get the vanadium in them and
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:41.420]   store it in their fatty tissue, and you've got to give it up.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.560]   You've got to give all that big fish up.
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:46.000]   You've got to give up your tuna, which you probably love, I know, and your swordfish,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.200]   and your salmon, and your mahi-mahi.
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:51.960]   And you better give up your lobsters, shellfish, crustaceans, and any kind of scallops, and
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:59.840]   chicken and turkey.
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.400]   I can't imagine giving up big fish, first of all, but why chicken and turkey?
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.800]   Because they eat big fish, you see, it's in the food chain.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.760]   They ground up big fish to make meal for chicken and turkey.
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:14.400]   So you just give it up, and I'll just give, I'll just give everything up if I were you,
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:15.720]   and just eat raw vegetables, please.
[01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.840]   I think that's the best thing we do for a while for your eyes, is raw, raw, please.
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.380]   The only reason vegetables are cooked, because in the old days, people had wooden false teeth,
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:26.400]   and they had to cook their vegetables, please raw, raw.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:27.920]   So I go out of there shaking and quaking.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:29.320]   I believe him, and I'm going to do it.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.320]   I'm going to give it a try.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.360]   He just has convinced me completely.
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:35.360]   And I start this raw vegetable diet, and it's, oh, it's unbelievable.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:39.240]   I go to the Grand Union, and what used to be a place that was filled with what I thought
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:46.440]   was food is now like a big factory with abstract items that are, there's nothing there for
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:47.440]   me.
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:50.900]   I mean, I walk by one aisle and look down and go, "Nothing there.
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:51.960]   Nothing there.
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   Nothing there.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:53.960]   Nothing there."
[01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:57.240]   I mean, in the old days, when I would go shopping, I would just not even make a list.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:01.120]   I'd just take a shopping cart and go down the aisle and put whatever caught my eye,
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:04.720]   my good eye, into the thing.
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:05.720]   And it was fun.
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:06.720]   It was a good time.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.040]   It would be treats, whatever.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:15.960]   Now I have to go to the corner for the vegetable area, which has got sprinklers that are going
[01:02:15.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   all the time.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:20.480]   Sure, it makes the vegetables look shiny, but it's rotting them.
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.480]   They're all soggy.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.480]   The celery's soggy.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:26.040]   So I'm going up to Union Square, the farmer's market, on Wednesdays and Saturdays, hoping
[01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:32.960]   that the Pennsylvania Dutch will bring some exotic turnip in or whatever, and I'm looking
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.460]   for odd and organic vegetables and something interesting, and I'm up there one Saturday
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:41.880]   and I see this sign, a woman's over there with an account that says, "Farm-raised trout
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.100]   from the Catskills."
[01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:45.440]   There's a fish I could eat.
[01:02:45.440 --> 01:02:47.920]   A farm-raised trout from the Catskills.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:54.120]   There's no way it could run into a sea cucumber up there.
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.520]   And I am really excited.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:01.440]   I mean, this is just the biggest thing, and I go and she's wrapping up four of them in
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:05.760]   newspaper and I'm chatting with her, excited and then I say, "By the way, just off hand,
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.820]   what do you feed your trout?"
[01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:13.040]   She says, "Chicken."
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.020]   So also I've given up drinking alcohol, which, oh God, giving up drinking alcohol was a big
[01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.020]   issue.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:21.400]   I mean, certainly after my mother's death, the only kind of religious ritual left in
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.640]   our family was cocktail hour, and I had always practiced it.
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.280]   I mean, what is a day without cocktail hour?
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:41.560]   It's just one big, "Ahhhh, bed."
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:42.560]   There's no gestalt.
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.560]   There's no relaxation.
[01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.000]   There's no shift of gears.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.720]   It's just too much reality.
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:53.920]   So I'm being a good boy, I've given that up, and I'm going to the food combining lectures
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:04:01.600]   that Dr. Axis is giving over at Nutley, and there are a number of his patients go to save
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:05.760]   money, so there are five or six of us around his desk, and he's talking about how to combine
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.200]   foods in order to help your eyesight.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:11.380]   And we're all there for the first lecture, and Don, his brother, has got a little tape
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:15.460]   recorder going on that your phone's on so he can sell you the tape later of the lecture.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:19.640]   And we're all gathered around and he begins that first lecture.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:20.640]   All right, people.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.640]   All right.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:23.320]   Let's begin with A for amino acids.
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.340]   Now, amino acids are the building blocks of what?
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:31.560]   And this one woman, that's kind of like a class know-it-all, goes, "Ah, protein."
[01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:35.400]   Very good, but please, raise your hand first.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.240]   I don't want to be a policeman, but raise your hand.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.960]   It was like a seventh grade biology class, the way he was running it.
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:44.280]   And he goes, "Now, please, tell me, would you eat your fruit before or after a meal?"
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:47.160]   This time the woman raises her hand and goes, "After, after.
[01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:48.680]   I always eat my fruit after."
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:49.680]   Wrong.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:50.680]   Wrong.
[01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:54.720]   Now, say, God forbid, you ate a steak.
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:58.120]   Just by mistake, you ate a steak.
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.400]   And then you had your fruit after and you had a banana.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.400]   Now, what would be happening to that steak?
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.240]   It would be down there in your stomach, digesting very slowly, and that banana would land on
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:11.040]   top of it and sit there and begin to digest very fast and begin to rot and putrefy, and
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.160]   it would cause explosive bowel movements, and I'll bet you have them, don't you?
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:16.680]   I'll bet you have them.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:22.000]   And in the middle of this, the 87-year-old mother runs in, waving this tear sheet that
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.760]   I filled out months ago, going, "Mr. Gray is guilty.
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.560]   Mr. Gray is guilty.
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.520]   Mr. Gray is guilty.
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   He cooks his corn.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.960]   He cooks his sweet potatoes.
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   He cooks his beets.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960]   He cooks his turnips.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   He even cooks his eggplant.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:44.400]   Doesn't he know he's got to eat them raw, raw, raw?"
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:48.240]   I just got out of there and didn't come back.
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:52.240]   I gave up on the food combining lectures, but I continued the raw vegetable diet, and
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:56.000]   it was really, it was heart-crossing havoc because my stomach wasn't taking to it well.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.680]   I was having enormous gas.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:06.480]   Renee and I were practically breaking up over it with the gas, and I ... God, what a bore
[01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.480]   life was.
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.320]   I'd given up all canned goods, all caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, sugar, meat, and pretty
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:20.760]   much sex, too, because they all seemed to be interconnected in some way, I hadn't realized.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:28.000]   I was getting really skinny, and Renee's mother saw me and said, "Spalding, Spalding, please,
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.400]   it looks like you've entered the Bermuda Triangle of Hell."
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:35.560]   Renee's mother's got this theory called the Bermuda Triangle of Hell.
[01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:40.560]   She says that between '50 and '53, everything starts going wrong.
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:44.960]   If you get through that, you'll live to be a ripe old age, but it's a tough one to get
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:45.960]   through.
[01:06:45.960 --> 01:06:49.000]   She got through it at '51, she had a heart attack and survived.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.120]   At '52, her husband died, Renee's father died, '50, her brother had a stroke.
[01:06:54.120 --> 01:06:56.320]   My mother killed herself at '52.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:01.200]   The Bermuda Triangle of Hell, and here I had entered it, and I was so lonely because I
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.880]   didn't know anyone else but the Macula Pucker.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.240]   My doctor said there were hundreds of people that had them, but he wouldn't give me any
[01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:10.560]   phone numbers.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:16.480]   So I was so lonely that I went to the Village Voice and put an ad in the bulletin board.
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:24.200]   I said, "Macula Pucker Club, does anyone else have one?
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:30.520]   Let's share stories."
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:34.040]   So then something happened, and I knew it was going to, this is always the depressing
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.600]   and the most frightening thing, the nurse called and said that there was time for me
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:44.560]   to come in and have the doctor do an exam to see how things were happening or not happening.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.920]   And that's always a terrifying time.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:48.960]   I go up to the office and I'm sitting there, I don't even bring a book anymore to read
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:53.400]   because I know they're going to dilate my pupils, and I'm sitting there munching on
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:08:03.000]   a raw sweet potato, I remember.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.440]   So while I'm sitting there, they put the drops in my eyes, and just before my eyes begin
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:11.960]   to, the pupils begin to dilate, this man comes out of the doctor's office with this drooping
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   eye.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:19.240]   Oh, I couldn't look, it was like the elephant man, it was like a, ugh, like a basset hound
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   but worse.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:23.360]   I said, "Nurse, nurse, what was that?"
[01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:25.040]   She goes, "Oh, that's the drooping eye."
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:28.720]   "Well, what would cause it?"
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.760]   "Oh, sometimes that's a result of the operation."
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:33.120]   "What?"
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:39.120]   "Oh, please, Mr. Gray, it's very easily corrected with corrective plastic surgery, please don't
[01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:42.760]   be such a silly Billy.
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.360]   Silly Billy, my God, I immediately go into shock.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:50.680]   I go into this bubble where I'm thinking, oh yes, Jesus is going to walk in here any
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.240]   minute into the waiting room, and just touch us like the good old days.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.380]   You know, bang, and the lame shall walk, and ta, the deaf shall hear, and la, the blind
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:02.660]   shall see, or I see E.T.'s finger coming at me like this, and touching it, and fixing
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.160]   my macula pucker with one electric touch.
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:10.480]   I go into fantasizing about magic and miracles, and that's what I want, clearly, as I'm sitting
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:11.480]   there in that doctor's office.
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:13.120]   I don't want medicine.
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:16.900]   And I'm thinking about magic, and I'm thinking how I must get in contact with it, because
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:21.440]   I know it exists in the world, and I know it may be able to help me, because, you know,
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:27.880]   I know there are tricks in the world, so there must be magic, because tricks are an imitation
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.160]   of the real thing, magic.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:35.080]   Now, I haven't had a lot of magical experiences in my life, but I can remember one, and was
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:38.980]   sitting there in the waiting room going through that in my mind, which I often do, go over
[01:09:38.980 --> 01:09:39.980]   that memory.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:47.040]   And it was 1986, I was trying to take a vacation alone in Bali, and travel in Bali, and I was
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.000]   intent on, you know, being a man alone, and I found I couldn't, I couldn't be alone and
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.100]   be at ease, and I was embarrassed by that, and couldn't tell anyone, and yet I'd heard
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:01.620]   there was this Balinese healer that worked with magical drawings outside of Ubud.
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:05.840]   So I thought, well, I'll go and visit him about my condition, and at least I won't be
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   lonely, that time I'll be visiting him, and I plan to go at cocktail hour just to give
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:14.480]   it power, you know, not, not drink, and go out there.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:20.640]   So I went out at sundown, and it was outside of Ubud, he had a little, a little house out
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:26.840]   there, and he was, he didn't speak much English, he laughed a lot, gold teeth, and he showed
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.420]   me these magical drawings that his grandfather had done, and I was going through them to
[01:10:30.420 --> 01:10:35.800]   look, and I came upon one that I identified with, it had no head, and that's what stopped
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:41.980]   me, and had four legs, a little man, I guess, with four legs and a grass skirt or a kilt,
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.980]   and his eyes were here in his chest, and they were twinkling, you know, good time, happy
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:52.500]   little eyes, having a good time kind of eyes, and a nose right here in his sternum, and
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:56.540]   I told the healer I could relate to this, and so he took the picture aside, I gave him
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:01.680]   some money, and he, he did a ceremony where he lit some incense, and put some flowers
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:07.640]   to it, and blew a mantra through a coconut shell into it, and said, "Now it has power,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:13.180]   you must hang it over your wall, bring it, light it incense, bring it flowers, and talk
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:16.060]   to it, and you will not, we will not be lonely."
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:20.660]   So I began doing it in Bali, I brought it incense, I lit it incense, brought it flowers,
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:25.640]   but he really didn't talk to it, it was kind of one of those relationships, you know.
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:29.280]   I was embarrassed to talk to it, until I got back to the States, and I framed the little
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:33.140]   man, and decided that I would bring him up to New Hampshire, to the MacDowell Company,
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:37.480]   when I was trying to finish my novel, because I knew it would be very lonely writing there,
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:41.820]   and in my studio I put him on the mantelpiece, and that's where I began to talk, and I would
[01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:47.180]   light the little pine incense there, and bring him, it was early spring, so I just had crocuses
[01:11:47.180 --> 01:11:50.780]   that I put for flowers, and I'd wake up in the morning and say, "Good morning little
[01:11:50.780 --> 01:11:55.560]   man, I'm just going to write some, and then maybe we'll go for a walk after I finish
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:58.760]   writing, and you'll get to see the New Hampshire woods, it's quite different from Bali, don't
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:03.120]   let it shock you, it's a, you're not quite as green or lush, because it's early spring,
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:07.360]   but it has an astia beauty of its own, but you'll see, you'll see."
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:11.380]   And then I'd go write, and every day I would forget, I'd get involved in the book and I'd
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:16.200]   charge out the door, go for my walk, and go back to the main house for dinner.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:21.700]   So one day I was charging out the door, and I heard this lonely little voice say, "What
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:32.800]   about the walk? What about the walk?" And I turned, "Ah." And I took it down off the
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:40.620]   mantelpiece, cradled him in my arm, like you'd hold a child, and went out the door. And there
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:50.220]   about 75 feet ahead of me was this huge maple tree that just had red buds, no leaves yet.
[01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:54.960]   And in the top of the tree was this teeming with sparrows, hopping around on the top.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:59.320]   And I was aiming the little man's eyes up at the sparrows. And as I looked up, the thought
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:03.500]   occurred to me that if I called a sparrow to me in my mind, it would come and light
[01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:08.920]   on me, it would land on me. Now before I even called a sparrow, as soon as I had the thought
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:16.800]   just of that, the sparrow went shoop, shoop, shoop, and started to fly around my head.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:21.240]   And I stood there with chills. It was such a superb feeling. I could feel its wings in
[01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:26.640]   my ears and hear the flutter. And it flew six times, maybe, around, and landed on my
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:32.480]   left shoulder and sat there. And we just stood there, the little man, myself, and the bird
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:40.760]   just kind of breathing together. I mean, I felt like St. Francis. I stood there for a
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:48.880]   long time with the bird on my shoulder, and then the bird just went shoop, shoop, shoop.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.980]   So I knew magic was in the world. And I was sitting there in the waiting room, remembering
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:13:59.520]   that, and all of a sudden the guy with the drooping eye trips over my foot and runs into
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:03.160]   this woman who's sitting down next to me, turning to me, saying, "What have you got
[01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:08.120]   wrong with you? I've got a macula pucker." And I go, "What? A macula? Oh my God!" And
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:13.760]   we hug. I said, "Why are you in here?" "What are you doing?" "Well, I'm afraid I'd come
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:17.080]   in for a preoperative exam, is what I've done. They want to work on me on Tuesday, but I'm
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:20.240]   not sure." "You're kidding. Oh, and if they ever told me that, I wouldn't know what to
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.480]   say. What do you think you're going to do?" "Well, I'm not sure that I'm going to go in,
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.640]   because I have to tell you something. I co-found the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital,
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.320]   and if you knew what I knew about hospitals, you wouldn't go in." "I know. I've heard.
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.160]   I know. My friends have told me that." "What have you been doing?" "Oh, some alternative
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.680]   therapy." "Oh, really? I have been doing some myself, and one of the reasons I don't want
[01:14:38.680 --> 01:14:43.000]   to go in is because a friend of mine from Idaho, a girlfriend of mine, just had an operation
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.360]   where she had a cancerous tumor removed from her breast, just pulled out with no cutting,
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.620]   no surgery of any sort. The man just reached in. She went to the Philippines to a Philippine
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:57.080]   psychic surgeon, and he pulled it out." "A Philippine psychic surgeon? You're kidding.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:03.260]   Why didn't I think of that?" "Well, you could still go. His name is Trini Boca. They referred
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:07.100]   to him as the Elvis Presley of psychic surgeons. I don't know why." "You're kidding." "Oh, I
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:11.420]   can get you the information." "You can? You can get me the information?" "Absolutely."
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:14.960]   And the nurse comes out at this point and goes, "Doctor will see you now, Mr. Gray."
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:23.440]   I said, "Well, I'm not ready to see the doctor. I'm off to the Philippines, and I do it. I've
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:26.920]   never done anything like this in my life. I get the information from the woman where
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:32.300]   to go, buy the ticket, and fly to Manila without drinking once on the plane, and I land in
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:36.400]   Manila, I rent a cheap hotel, and I go down to where I'm told Trini Boca hangs out where
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:41.040]   he does his operations. It's a psychic surgeon center that used to be a discotheque. They've
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:46.880]   converted it, and they say that it begins at 9.30. I get down there at 9.30 promptly.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:51.040]   The major people that are there is a huge busload of Japanese. Forty Japanese is going
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:56.880]   to have a psychic surgery tour. And I guess, well, maybe 20 Japanese are being operated
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:03.120]   on the other 20 of filming the operation because they all have these video cameras galore.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:08.260]   And then we all go into this chapel together. The Japanese are praying at a kind of Shinto
[01:16:08.260 --> 01:16:12.400]   shrine that they have, and I'm left with Jesus, this huge statue of Jesus. I don't know what
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:16.840]   to say to him. I'm a nervous wreck. I'm jet lagging. I'm terrified of this whole thing.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:21.080]   I'm really out on a limb, and I'm just there. And then after the praying, you start down
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:27.360]   this carda, and it's got pictures all along the walls of Trini Boca operating on various
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.200]   people. Psychic surgery, and it looks like the Mayo Family Clinic book. I mean, it works.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:35.880]   And at one point, he's reaching in. He's got his fingers in around someone's eyeball. And
[01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:40.220]   the next photograph, he's holding up an eyeball. He's holding it up to display it. You get
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:49.220]   to the end of this carda, and there's this huge crucifix of Christ. Well, who else? Look,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:52.000]   you have to remember, we were in a country, and I was in a country in the Philippines where
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:56.840]   at Easter, they crucify each other. They nail themselves to crosses. And we turn, and we
[01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:03.840]   go in to the operating room, and I walk in, and I cannot believe my eye. It's just...
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:09.600]   We walk in, and there, standing under the fluorescent light, standing over an operating
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:14.560]   table, is Trini Boca, the Elvis Presley of psychic surgeons. His eyes rolled up in his
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:20.100]   head in semi-trance. He's about 46 years old. He's got a kind of Prince Valiant haircut.
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:26.200]   He's got gold chains around his neck, gold rings in his fingers, bracelets, gold bracelets,
[01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.720]   Palm Beach white lattice, Palm Beach leisure shoes, a kind of Las Vegas bar-blue energy
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:37.720]   coming off of him, and a blue surgical gown, and a bushes apron. And on either side of
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:44.320]   the operating table, two men with mops. And the Japanese come in, and some of them go
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:48.520]   in to observe, and others take off their clothes and line up. I'm getting immediately in observing.
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:52.040]   I'm a GOG. I'm not taking off my clothes. I am blah, blah, blah. I can't believe what
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:55.360]   I'm seeing. And the ones that get down to their underwear, the women are bare-breasted
[01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:01.480]   just in their underpants, and the same with the men. And it begins. Trini just nods his
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:06.960]   head like this, and up, up, up. First woman runs up, lies out on the table. He buries
[01:18:06.960 --> 01:18:11.420]   his fingers into her stomach, up to his knuckles. Blood shoots six feet into the air, spraying
[01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:17.040]   the other Japanese. They're running like children running under a bloody sprinkler in summertime.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.900]   The men are down on the floor with the mops, mopping it up like this, the blood like crazy.
[01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.400]   She runs around to the back of the line. A man gets up, lies out on the table, and his
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.080]   sleeves are rolled up at this point. He's not bringing this stuff out of the air. He's
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:30.680]   pulling out of the people, and he begins to pull out this huge meatball the size of the
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:35.900]   melon out of this man's stomach. He's going, "Oh, snap. Pop." He rolls it in a bucket.
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:40.640]   This man goes around to the back of the line. A woman gets up. He reaches into the woman's
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:44.200]   stomach and pulls out what it looks like these bloody grapes and begins squeezing them like
[01:18:44.200 --> 01:18:48.360]   a kid playing with his own shit and hurls them down on her breasts. They mop them off
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.780]   of her. She goes around to the back of the line. A man comes. A Japanese man lies flat.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:57.460]   Trini pulls down his underwear, bears his round full rump, starts reaching up his ass
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:19:02.440]   with gold rings on his fingers, and starts pulling out what looks like spaghetti with
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.880]   red meat sauce. It's supposed to be hemorrhoids. He hurls them into a bucket. That man goes
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:10.860]   around. A woman comes, goes around, and lies down. He begins working on her Adam's apple.
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:15.040]   It pours out pus, green and yellow, tongues of it. He's catching it in a cup. She goes
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:19.200]   around. They all go around one more time, have basically the same thing happen to him.
[01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:23.800]   He goes over, blesses them, crosses them, goes over to the crucifix, genuflects, bends
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:35.360]   over, wipes some blood off his white shoe, lights a cigarette, and leaves. I go back
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:47.200]   to my hotel and have my first drink. I have 12 of them, in fact. 12 San Miguel beers,
[01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:52.120]   and I'm like, oh my God, what am I going to do? My God, give me another beer. No, no one,
[01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:56.400]   all the Japanese couldn't speak English. The only ones there are the Philippine waiters,
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:01.180]   and I'm going, oh God, I spent all this money, all this money to come here. I can't possibly
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:04.640]   go through anything like that. How could I get on that table? Oh my God, give me another
[01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:11.480]   beer. Oh, you go to Trini, do you? Did you go to Trini? Yes, I went to him. Oh, he's
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:15.880]   very good. He's very powerful. You know you can be healed if you believe. Believe? Well,
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:22.200]   is that a prerequisite? I didn't know. I thought he was going to be like Jesus or E.T. He just
[01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:28.760]   touched me. Give me another beer, please. Sir, sir, you must believe if you'll be healed,
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:33.000]   and then you must go home if you don't believe, because don't you have belief? No. Believe,
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:38.400]   what do you mean? I doubt everything. Doubt is my bottom line. The only thing I don't
[01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:43.160]   doubt is my doubt. Oh God, give me another beer, please. But sir, don't you believe in
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:47.800]   a creator? Who is your creator? Don't you believe in it? Creator? No, I thought I was
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:55.480]   idiopathic. God, God. But sir, you are praying all the time. What do you mean? Oh, you're
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:21:01.200]   saying God, God, God, give me a beer. God, oh my God, all the time you are praying. I
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:07.340]   go to bed, I can't sleep. All I see is meatballs flying. I wake up after a little sleep and
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:15.460]   I go, oh, AIDS. That's what it is. Why couldn't I just get clear on that? I mean, what American
[01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:19.600]   isn't blood phobic? You can't possibly give yourself over to a psychic surgeon and be
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.240]   operated on when you're that afraid of blood. So I went down, I went down 45 minutes early
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:28.280]   to tell Trini what the thing was. You know, I know, can you please, I said, just wash
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:31.560]   your hands in rubbing alcohol and come to my room in the afternoon and do a private
[01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:36.580]   operation. You've got to be considerate about this blood thing. I can't relax with the AIDS
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:42.760]   thing in my mind. No AIDS, no. We don't do the private operation, we do group operation
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:46.860]   because of the power of that. But there is no AIDS here, you see. I have great compassion
[01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:51.480]   with the people with the AIDS, but I can't, I cannot operate on them. I tried, I did not
[01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:57.400]   know the man was here, that he had AIDS and my hands would not enter his body, you see.
[01:21:57.400 --> 01:22:07.480]   They just go, cuckoo. They go cuckoo. So you must not worry. You will come and be operated
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:13.000]   on now. So I go in quaking and shaking, I think I've got to go through with it at least
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   once, I've got to give it a try. And I get in the line with the Japanese and I feel that
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   power, you know, they're just, I take off my clothes, when they take off their clothes
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.020]   I'm stripped down to my red Fruit of the Loom jockey shorts. And I get right into the middle
[01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:31.780]   of this Japanese group because they get that kamikaze energy. The way they get up on that
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:37.120]   table with no doubt. And it begins again and round they go and whoop, out come the meatballs
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:41.720]   and the bloody grapes and my turn comes to jump up on that table and I jump up, it's
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:50.660]   like leaping into a living Bosch painting. A combination of that and a Catholic morgue,
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:56.960]   it's like the blood and the smell and I'm lying there going, just my left eye Trini,
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:23:07.520]   it's just my left eye, remember, don't pull any meatballs out please. He raises his hands,
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:13.000]   sleeves are rolled up, shows me there's nothing in his hands. His fingers are not false. He
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:25.400]   goes and washes his hands off in what looks like, basically looks like a bucket of blood.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:30.840]   Then he picks up some cotton gauze. This is where the debunkers like Amazing Randy claim
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:34.800]   that they hide the blood pellets. But no, this is how he could read my mind. He opens
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:42.680]   the gauze, shows me nothing's in them and he comes at my eye with both fingers and gets
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:46.660]   here and he begins to enter either side of my eye. At that point I have an image of my
[01:23:46.660 --> 01:23:51.980]   eye as a vagina and his fingers as two bloody cocks and you know and I have a shut down
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:59.480]   virginal response. As soon as he sticks his fingers in the corner of my eye, blood pours
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:08.660]   out. Great amount of blood like clots. But it doesn't feel like it's coming from somewhere.
[01:24:08.660 --> 01:24:11.880]   Because they're sopping it up, it's running down my face. And as soon as he pulls his
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:16.640]   fingers out, pop, the blood stops. And I run around to the end of the line and instead
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.560]   of going to the end of the line, I go into the men's room. Look in the mirror, I'm standing
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:25.940]   in my eye, there's no blood in there. There's no extra blood. What is going on? Also my
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:30.320]   eye isn't any better. And he wants to do it seven more times. That's how it's going to
[01:24:30.320 --> 01:24:34.100]   work. And all I can hear at this point is my friends in Barrington Island who used to
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:39.320]   ask me if I believed in doctors saying, "Say you went to a guy that started pulling meatballs
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:50.380]   out of you the size of melons. Would you go to a doctor then?" Yes. And I fly back to New
[01:24:50.380 --> 01:24:54.700]   York and the nurse calls me in and here's what the agreement is. Here's how they kind
[01:24:54.700 --> 01:24:59.000]   of couch me into it. They want to give me a pre-operative exam. Then I have a choice
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.400]   of in two weeks time whether I have the operation or not, but at least I'll be set up for it.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:07.100]   And they want to examine my eye. Anyway, so I come in and they say if I come in on Friday
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:11.120]   morning, fine, there'll be no one there. And it's true, it's empty. It's early and they
[01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:15.880]   dilate my pupil and I'm sitting there, pupils, and I'm sitting waiting and things are pretty
[01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:21.320]   hazy and I see coming out of my doctor's office this guy, short man in a pinstripe suit and
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:26.320]   he's moving like an old-time movie, like a Buster Keaton movie, backing up, waving, like
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:32.320]   this, tch, tch, tch, tch, tch, tch, tch, tch, automatic. Looks like a windup doll, you know.
[01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:37.000]   And he turns and he's walking toward me and he's got, it's the strangest thing, he's got
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:42.000]   one of those rubber Nixon masks on you could buy at the 42nd Street joke shops when Nixon
[01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:50.160]   was president. And I think, "What would this be about?" And he gets closer down the hall
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:26:06.380]   to me and I realize it is Richard Nixon. And he's walking toward me with the intent and
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:10.440]   direction as if he's gonna come right up to me and say something like, "Hi, I saw Swimming
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.880]   to Cambodia and I loved it." And I think, "Why would he be walking up to me?" And then I
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:19.080]   thought, "Well, maybe, you know, wait a minute, maybe his pupils are dilated and he thinks
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:30.560]   I'm Ralph Lauren." So he gets right up to me and he says, I don't stand up, I just say,
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.840]   "Oh, hi." And he goes, "Hello." And then he swerves and goes out. I go into my doctor's
[01:26:35.840 --> 01:26:39.120]   office and he goes, "Hello, Mr. Gray, how is the Philippines?" I said, "Please, I don't
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:42.960]   want to talk about that." "Was that Richard Nixon?" "Oh, yes, nothing the matter with
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:53.440]   him." I said, "Well, there is no justice in the world, is there?" And my doctor said,
[01:26:53.440 --> 01:26:56.720]   "Now, wait a minute, he didn't do anything worse than Reagan did to America." Now, I
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.560]   did not want to get into a discussion comparing Nixon and Reagan if I was about to be operated
[01:27:00.560 --> 01:27:06.560]   on by this doctor. And I also thought they were probably discussing China policy anyway.
[01:27:06.560 --> 01:27:13.120]   But you know what's strange? For me what's strange is that seeing Nixon come out of my
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:20.600]   doctor's office gave me the faith and courage to have the operation. That and Rene holding
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.240]   my hand all the way right up to the operation, I can't, it was terrifying to go in. They
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:27.920]   gave me a local so I could hear them talking during the whole thing. They were talking
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:34.300]   about some party they'd been to the night before. And the music was, they had the rock
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:41.440]   and roll on, on the radio. I remember Crocodile Rock. Then they had, let's see, they put a
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:47.480]   gas bubble in my eye. After the operation to prevent glaucoma, they didn't tell me they
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:54.300]   were going to do that. And they gave me a video of the operation and sent me home. And
[01:27:54.300 --> 01:28:01.760]   the video was titled "Swimming to Macula Pucker." So we had a sense of humor, the doctor said.
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:05.620]   I get home and I find out because of this gas bubble, which is not something they told
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:13.560]   me about, I have to, you know, face down until the bubble vanishes. Rene puts pillows on
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:20.360]   either side of the bed to keep me from rolling over. I'm face down on the floor all day.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.780]   I have to walk down like this or eat face down. I remember the only time I walked was
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:29.420]   to go up to, I joined the library for the blind where you can get the unabridged tapes
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:33.140]   and listen to those, books on tape. And Rene guided me up and I'm walking down the street
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:41.520]   looking at basically splattered bubble gum, dog shit, cigarette butts. And we go up and
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:51.400]   go to the library and get a miracle worker, I think it was. And then when I went back,
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:58.600]   oh, Rene fixed mirrors up so I could see the video without raising my hand. It was incredible
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:04.600]   of the operation. Talk about Trini Boca. This, first of all, my macula was magnified. It
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:09.900]   looked like a sun. And then you see this little pincer like a crab claw pulling this gassama
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:17.640]   thread off, which is the edema. And without touching, once, the retina. And while talking
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:22.100]   about a party that he was at the night before. It's amazing. And then the camera pulls out
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:26.300]   and there's all this white and then you suddenly see stitches the size of ropes because it's
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:31.100]   magnified. It's like the Andalusian dog magnified a thousand times. Rene is in the bathroom
[01:29:31.100 --> 01:29:37.040]   right now and I'm just looking at it through mirrors thinking, "It's not my eye. This is
[01:29:37.040 --> 01:29:46.240]   a movie." And then 14 days go by and then, speaking of movies, the big dramatic time
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:50.480]   comes and the movies when you're supposed to have the patches removed and we go down.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:57.080]   I wasn't trying to expect too much and they removed the patch and basically it was a pretty
[01:29:57.080 --> 01:30:02.960]   blurry situation. I mean, looking through my left eye was like looking through a car
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:07.480]   window during a rainstorm with no windshield wipers. Or through the bottom of an empty
[01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:15.160]   Coke bottle. My right eye, I suddenly appreciated it enormously. And we went out and sat in
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.360]   the park, I remember, for me to try to get used to this and just sitting there looking
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:24.680]   this. It was like I had a ghost between my eyes, like a hair I wanted to brush. It's
[01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:29.880]   still there. It's like a, "Wait, if I could just quite get it right." And we sat in the
[01:30:29.880 --> 01:30:37.280]   park and I remember seeing leaves blowing and we had children running, a red ball rolling,
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:44.680]   starlings taking off. Then covering my right eye and no leaves. Blur of children, no red
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:58.320]   ball, no birds. Cover my left eye, ecstasy. Cover my right, despair. Left, ecstasy, despair.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:09.240]   And I suddenly realized I was living the perfect yin and yang existence. And I knew then there
[01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:14.280]   were tricks in the world. There was magic, there was miracles, there was medicine and
[01:31:14.280 --> 01:31:20.040]   there was also reality and life goes on. And it was going on because Renée was turning
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:27.160]   to me and saying, "Now, Spald, I think we should get married." And I realized why we
[01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:31.760]   should, she said. Because when I was in the hospital and they kept calling, referring
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:37.960]   to me as the girlfriend, I couldn't get access to you. You're going to get older, you're
[01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:49.800]   in it. Going to be in a lot more. I think we should do it. I'm so nervous about proposing
[01:31:49.800 --> 01:31:55.680]   to her, it feels so awkward and odd and weird that I have to do it in front of my therapist.
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:00.320]   Now, I'm not saying Renée isn't nervous either about the whole thing. I mean, she kept saying,
[01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:10.560]   "Spald, you know, we really have to set our debting weight." So we set the debting weight
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:16.920]   for six months after the proposal just to give us a chance to get to know each other.
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:21.160]   And then it was Renée's wonderful idea to rent a house in Wainscot and have the wedding
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:26.660]   on the beach and then have the reception at the house and rent it for the month of August.
[01:32:26.660 --> 01:32:30.640]   So two weeks to prepare for the wedding to get used to the idea and just get, you know,
[01:32:30.640 --> 01:32:34.760]   she was doing a lot of the work and then get married in the middle of August and then have
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:40.200]   two weeks to just hang out and have the honeymoon. So we get out to the house and I think this
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:43.840]   is all going to be fine and just everything's going to be hunky-dory and I begin to get
[01:32:43.840 --> 01:32:49.360]   freaked. I am not easy to live with. Suddenly I'm like, "Oh, agitated." Arguing with Renée
[01:32:49.360 --> 01:32:54.160]   and pacing a lot. And not being able to sleep and groaning and walking up and down the beach,
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:58.460]   unable to lie on the beach and just lie still and just relax. And I'm walking up and down
[01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:01.980]   like a man who's lost his contact lenses. Every time Renée points out the area on the
[01:33:01.980 --> 01:33:06.160]   beach where we're going to have the wedding ceremony, I take a low, big, wide arc around
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:09.940]   it going, "Really? Over there? Is it going to be there in that spot?" I finally go to
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:13.060]   my lawyer and say, "Ron, I'm getting cold feet. I don't know. I don't know if I can
[01:33:13.060 --> 01:33:19.120]   go through with it." He said, "Spaulding, be a mensch. Please, you know, you're an actor.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:27.460]   Rock like you want to get married." And I'm walking up and down the beach, up and down
[01:33:27.460 --> 01:33:33.260]   the beach, looking at all these various women thinking, "Why not her?" And then to diffuse
[01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:38.600]   their sexuality, all I have to do is cover my right eye. The men and the women are the
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:43.400]   same blur. The one thing that I'm really helping me and I'm regressing is body surfing. Oh,
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:46.420]   that's all I'm doing. I'm just riding the waves as a good body surfer as a kid and it's
[01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:50.300]   making me feel very present and taking my mind off my fears of marriage and this, that
[01:33:50.300 --> 01:33:54.540]   and the other end is a storm. There's a big storm about four, five days, I think it was
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:33:58.920]   a week before the wedding, that creates a seapass the following day. And the wind is
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:03.020]   off the shore and the seapass is not unlike an undertow. It's where a wave breaks and
[01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:07.300]   it curls around a great volume of water because of the angle of the beach, goes out underneath
[01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:12.660]   and creates a secondary wave that goes backwards. So I was riding this backward wave and I was
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:17.180]   going up and I just thought I was going up and down, bobbing, the way I love to do. And
[01:34:17.180 --> 01:34:20.620]   I was, but I was going up and out, up and out, up and out. And I didn't realize how
[01:34:20.620 --> 01:34:25.300]   quickly and how far I was out until I saw Renee on shore and how far away she was and
[01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:32.060]   this scared me. Now I am really a great man of great procrastination. I mean, I just could
[01:34:32.060 --> 01:34:39.500]   sit on it but I thought, you know, it might not be a bad idea to yell help. What do I
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:47.660]   have to lose? And so I go, Renee, help! And she goes, can't come out now, Spald, I just
[01:34:47.660 --> 01:34:53.700]   ate. Oh my gosh, she can't hear me because of the wind off the shore. Now the fact that
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:56.940]   she can't hear me means no one can hear me. It means I'm totally isolated and this
[01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:00.140]   puts me into something, another thing you're not supposed to do, which immediately you
[01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:05.120]   do, panic. And I panicked and the adrenaline went off of my body. So I was exhausted in
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:09.420]   30 seconds and the sea puss was slapping me in the face and I was swallowing water and
[01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:14.220]   I thought I might be drowning and I began to yell help in a big way, a big way that
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:19.860]   covered everything from my toes to my nose. Help, help Renee, I'm drowning. Help, I'm
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:27.300]   going blind in my left eye. Help, I'm going bald. Help, I'm getting married. Help, I'm
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:35.180]   going to die. Help, I'm going to disappear from this earth forever one day. Help. Renee
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:39.600]   rounds up, there's no lifeguard on the beach, she rounds up three guys and says, go out
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:44.240]   in there and get him. We don't know anything about life saving lady, you're the men,
[01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:53.680]   get out there. I see these three frightened faces coming at me. One of them has this yellow
[01:35:53.680 --> 01:35:59.740]   boogie board, thank God I'm thinking. If I can get to the boogie board, I won't pull
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:05.760]   them down, I'll be able to float. It gives me enough, I'm choking on water, it gives
[01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:09.180]   me enough, I can swim just to get to the board and they begin to pull me in on the board.
[01:36:09.180 --> 01:36:13.100]   I'm spitting up water on the beach, they're lifting me up, two of them between them like
[01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:16.980]   Jesus, while I'm choking while someone else is, while the other guy is photographing me
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:23.720]   because they recognize me. They recognize me from the poster of swimming in Cambodia
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:32.440]   where my head's emerged in the water, you see. Art imitates life, life imitates art.
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.820]   The first man, the one with the yellow boogie board, tells me that he's a chiropractor
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:39.940]   from Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania and he said, if ever you do a monologue in which you tell
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:54.500]   a story about this almost drowning, please mention my name, Phil Hampton. The other man
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:58.900]   told me he had a decade in summer, he did nothing good for anyone and had just been
[01:36:58.900 --> 01:37:02.940]   hell with his girlfriend and had been just a real pig and what a wonderful thing it was
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:06.820]   that I almost drowned. Thank you, thank you for almost drowning, he said, so I could have
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:12.140]   done something good. The third man said, you know, you really got balls, I couldn't yell
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:19.380]   help like that no matter what was happening to me. And I realized I'd just had my bachelor
[01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:36.020]   party. Four, I think four or five days after this almost drowning, Hurricane Bob hits.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:42.060]   It wipes out the whole island, oh God, the trees are down, there's no electricity, no
[01:37:42.060 --> 01:37:45.660]   water, Renee wakes up with a rash crying saying, what are we going to do, what are we going
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:53.020]   to do, the relatives will have to shit in the woods. I don't see how we can get married,
[01:37:53.020 --> 01:37:59.900]   I don't know. I said, really? I think you're right, Renee, I see it as a sign. She said,
[01:37:59.900 --> 01:38:09.100]   well I see it as a challenge. And she does, and she rents port-a-sans and outdoor barbeque,
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:16.100]   and she got the whole thing worked out. It's amazing how quickly, and two days before the
[01:38:16.100 --> 01:38:20.380]   ceremony is supposed to happen, the water and electricity is restored, most of the trees
[01:38:20.380 --> 01:38:26.100]   are cleaned up, and the day of the wedding itself is exquisite, dry, high white fluffy
[01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:31.940]   clouds, light breeze, magic hour, sun going down, we gather about 40 of us on the beach,
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:40.700]   beautiful light. I bring the little man down as a witness to put him on the chair. Our
[01:38:40.700 --> 01:38:44.940]   lawyer is there doing the ceremony, Renee and I wrote it together with him, and he joined
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:52.940]   the Universal Church of God in Fresno, California for $35 to do the ceremony. Renee is running
[01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:59.140]   barefoot toward us all, in her Grace Kelly powder pink wedding dress, and she gets there
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:04.940]   and we have the ceremony and it ends with, "May this couple be together for as long as
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:13.940]   they both shall love." And we go back to the house, and we have the reception. And I drink
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:21.940]   vodka, and I eat big fish. And I drink white wine and I have some wedding cake, and I have
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:26.940]   some coffee, and I smoke a cigar and I have a big glass of brandy, and I eat and I drink
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:33.940]   and I smoke everything that could make me blind. Thank you for coming.
