[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.580]   Good evening, and welcome to A Personal History
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.620]   of the American Theater.
[00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.900]   Being my history, I'm Spalding Gray,
[00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.180]   and I'll be covering the years 1960 to 1970,
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.220]   free associating from about 47 plays that I've been in,
[00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.940]   the titles of which are printed on these cards here,
[00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.620]   and the cards have been shuffled,
[00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.280]   and I'm going to reveal the first play.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:23.580]   The Knack, not a very good play, I think, by Angelico.
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.820]   I happen to have a copy of the text here,
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.140]   but I'm not going to read from it,
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.840]   but just tell you that I played the role of the stud,
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.260]   Tolan, and I thought I should have been cast as Colon,
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.580]   but P. Raymond Marounis got that role,
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.320]   and Apollo Dukakis was also in this play,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.300]   and an actress named Patricia Greger,
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.860]   who was a very good actress on stage,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.020]   really came alive on stage, very animated,
[00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.460]   and when she got off stage, she just sort of dried up,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.400]   and went to her hotel room.
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.860]   It was in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, Theatre by the Sea,
[00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.780]   and we were all staying in the Rockingham Hotel,
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.740]   and I remember Pat was afraid to come out of her room,
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.960]   and also wouldn't use the tubs, the big public bathtubs,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.340]   because she was afraid of catching syphilis from them.
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.460]   Anyway, my father brought my mother to see this play,
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.180]   The Knack, when she was, during the time that she had,
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.020]   it was suffering from an incurable nervous breakdown,
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.260]   and she was expecting to see me
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.040]   in Long Day's Journey into Night.
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.820]   (audience laughs)
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.780]   Which was the play that we did after The Knack,
[00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.220]   but my father thought it'd been a bad idea
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.420]   to bring her, you see, to see Long Day's Journey,
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.260]   but I think she...
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.080]   (audience laughs)
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.460]   Free Penny Opera.
[00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.120]   This is done by Francis Cleveland, Grover Cleveland's son,
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.580]   up in Tamworth, New Hampshire.
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.780]   He was head of the Republican Party up there,
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.860]   and he did the Bond Stormer,
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.500]   he did a thing called a Bond Stormer Summer Theater,
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.420]   as a hobby, where he had all these actors
[00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.380]   who were acting their, acting up a storm in soap operas
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.100]   in the winter, they'd come up there and act their hearts out
[00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.540]   at the Bond Stormer Summer Theater,
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.940]   and they did this production of Free Penny Opera.
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.640]   It was very, I was an apprentice up there,
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.260]   I didn't do much work, I was allergic to hammers,
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.640]   so I would stand around and talk a lot,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.020]   but they did pay me.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.300]   And the thing that was odd about this town,
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.820]   it was a very conservative town,
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.500]   he was afraid of upsetting the minister
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.660]   who had a church right next door to the theater,
[00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.740]   because he thought this was a communist play, Francis did.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.160]   And also, the woman who played the lead, Jenny,
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.340]   couldn't sing, so he assigned all of her songs
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.700]   to different people in the cast,
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.820]   so it was a real mixed bag.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.500]   And as I say, the town, it was a town ordinance
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.860]   that all the houses had to be,
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.080]   the fronts of the houses had to be painted white,
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.420]   if they faced the main road.
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.260]   You could paint the sides Battleship Gray
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.720]   or Lincoln Green, I suppose,
[00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.940]   but the fronts had to be white.
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.620]   And about this time,
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.300]   well, I was a bit of a gin alcoholic then in those days,
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.620]   I guess I was 21 years old.
[00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.900]   I used to go down to the state store
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.780]   and get a quart of gin,
[00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.100]   then fill up an empty Miller High Life bottle
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.180]   and bring it in my engineer boot and run the lights.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.300]   Drinking this gin.
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.180]   And I can remember one night I got a little high
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.260]   and went out in a Jeep out into the mountains,
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.540]   just out into the hills,
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.420]   and I was throwing little lady fingers out the windows,
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.620]   little firecrackers, it was nothing disturbing,
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.100]   but they called the state police
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.020]   and the state police came down to interrogate all of us
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.360]   in the theater to see where these fireworks came from.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.540]   Now, I guess they didn't have much else to do in the town,
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.540]   so they had plenty of time to interrogate us
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.100]   and I have always had a problem,
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.180]   I've always wanted to tell everyone everything,
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.900]   so I was kind of being very careful of not,
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.620]   that I was not going to tell the state police
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.900]   where the fireworks came from.
[00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.340]   I was sitting on it.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.700]   And I got out in the car
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.540]   and my turn came from the interrogation
[00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.220]   and this very big thunderstorm came up
[00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.680]   and lightning hit about six feet in front of the car.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.940]   I saw it hit the pavement and the police said,
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:56.660]   all right, that's the first warning.
[00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.760]   (audience laughing)
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.060]   It just came out of me like this,
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.820]   A-frame cabin up in the hills under the bed, like that.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:13.620]   I would stay up with the apprentices
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:14.960]   and do the installations.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.340]   They'd have to build a new set every weekend for the show.
[00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.900]   I'd hang around and talk.
[00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.260]   And I can remember one night,
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:22.220]   we would drink a lot of coffee to stay up.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.660]   I walked out and it was just the breaking of dawn outside
[00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.500]   and it was this dairy farm right next to the theater.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.420]   I mean, it'd always been there,
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.380]   but it happened to be beautiful this time.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.460]   And it had the lights on in the barn
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:38.580]   where the farmer was just going out to do the milking.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.420]   And I couldn't see the dairy farm as anything else
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.100]   but an extension of the theater set
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.820]   we'd been working on all night.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.360]   And ever since then, I've never been able to see a dairy farm
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.400]   as anything but a theater set.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.820]   He Who Gets Slapped.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.820]   I played he and I got slapped at Emerson College.
[00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.260]   It's a Russian play about this clown
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.300]   who was supposed to be ugly.
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:09.640]   And I actually became quite ugly by the last act
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.060]   because I had three makeup changes
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.380]   and they never had time to take the makeup off me.
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.500]   So they just put more makeup on.
[00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.740]   So my face was peeling.
[00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.220]   It's about this clown, his act is that he gets slapped.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.060]   He's ugly.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.600]   He's in love with this beautiful bareback writer
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.820]   named Consuelo.
[00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.780]   And everyone in the company,
[00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:26.420]   everyone gets to slap him all the time
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:28.240]   but no one in the company could do it.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.700]   No one in the acting company could do it.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.480]   So Louis Lopez Sapero, the director said,
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.660]   "Hit him, hit him."
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.020]   And jumped up and said like this.
[00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.140]   And he went like that.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:36.540]   Well, I didn't counter at all.
[00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.720]   I saw stars.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.200]   The only ones I've ever seen in the theater since.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.840]   And he said, "Oh, now you may hit me back."
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.480]   And I guess I was in my masochistic stage then.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.320]   I didn't do it.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:50.620]   And I went on with the play.
[00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.960]   Now, the most delicious part of the play for me
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.080]   was when I was coming in from my street reality
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.460]   outside in the street, going through the makeup change
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.060]   and then walking out behind the curtain
[00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.620]   and lying down in this Freudian dive in Viennese type couch
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:05.140]   and lighting an authentic Russian cigarette.
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:06.620]   Everything was authentic in the play.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.940]   And it's just waiting on this dark stage
[00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:10.280]   for the curtain to open.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.880]   And feeling the audience's presence
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:12.860]   on the other side of the curtain,
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.420]   but feeling in this luscious limbo.
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.080]   And I could have sat in that for hours.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.820]   And I used to have recurrent dreams after that
[00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.980]   over and over again of being sitting on a dark stage
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:22.580]   waiting for the curtain to open.
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:28.100]   Under Milkwood.
[00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.340]   I used to like Dylan Thomas a lot
[00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:33.360]   until I got involved in three productions of Under Milkwood.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.520]   Since the cards have been shuffled,
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.860]   it's hard to tell whether this is the first, second or third,
[00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.420]   but I'll call it the first.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:44.860]   And the first was at Emerson College.
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.060]   We toured it to Wellesley College.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.940]   And afterwards, there was this beautiful
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.940]   wasp Wellesley woman lounging or standing in the corner
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.800]   after the show.
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.300]   And I thought, my gosh, she looks like she liked the show.
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.460]   I bet there's a good chance I could speak with her.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.740]   But I was too afraid to even speak to her
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.280]   because I went to Emerson and she went to Wellesley.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:09.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.280]   The Enchanted.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.760]   The Curious Savage.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.500]   This was the first play I was ever in.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.420]   I think all my life I wanted to be in theater,
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.280]   but I didn't know it.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.180]   Life was always very flat and interesting to me
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.440]   and quite dull as a child.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.900]   In fact, I think that an actor,
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.980]   being an actor is an ontological state.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.900]   Some people just happen to find their way into it
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.740]   as a profession and some don't.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.880]   But you're just born quite simply without any sense of being
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.300]   or any sense of self.
[00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.180]   And you're always doing the inappropriate emotion
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.520]   at the inappropriate time.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.600]   And you're desperate looking for some sort of emotional
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.700]   structure out there that you can pour yourself into.
[00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:49.040]   And I thought, well, you know, I would make up things.
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.100]   I would dramatize my life, you see,
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.480]   and to hype it up a little.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.580]   Like say some fireworks would go off in the yard
[00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:57.120]   and I'd rush to the window and say,
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.020]   "Mom, come quick, rust your mom, our neighbor.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:02.420]   "He's up on his roof shooting his kids."
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.220]   And, you know, this was in the old days
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.180]   before this happened so much, you know.
[00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:10.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.140]   My mother would rush to the window and she'd say,
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.860]   "Oh, Spuddy dear, why do you have to do this?"
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.420]   She started in collaboration with me.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.100]   Yeah, Spud, that was my nickname.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:22.700]   And so finally, I really thought I should get into theater
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:23.780]   and I was in boarding school,
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:26.580]   kind of a tacky academy up in Maine.
[00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:31.500]   And so my junior year, I started to read,
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:33.060]   or was going to read for this play,
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.860]   but I have a kind of dyslexia.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.620]   I get very nervous whenever I have to perform
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:38.820]   and I can't see the words.
[00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:40.900]   I can only see them one at a time.
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:43.660]   So I couldn't, I didn't get the role.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.260]   Plus I was shaking so hard
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.180]   that I couldn't see the words to begin with.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.660]   So my senior year, I managed to hold the book down, you see.
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:53.660]   I get it down and I did read one word at a time, thanks.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.660]   So this animal got big and grew an enormous great long jaw
[00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.340]   so it could scoop.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.100]   And I got the role because this took place
[00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.740]   in an insane asylum, you see.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.140]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:06.900]   They thought I was perfect for it.
[00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.900]   Everyone has a fantasy in this asylum
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.100]   that they can do something.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.900]   Mine was that I was Hannibal and I could play the violin.
[00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.340]   Then everyone's fantasy comes true.
[00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.820]   At the end, I play the violin that they put on a record.
[00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.540]   It's beautiful, you know, everyone's fantasy comes true.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:22.460]   But opening night, there was a rug they put down.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.580]   It wasn't there for rehearsals, it was squares.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.500]   And I had to make a downstage left cross.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.940]   And I looked down, I saw these squares
[00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.940]   and I did this quick improvised hopscotch with my fiddle,
[00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:33.500]   my violin, you know, hopscotch down across the rug.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.460]   And everyone laughed, you see, in the audience.
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.020]   And I was completely hooked.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.060]   I was just like I had been shot up with some drug.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:42.180]   And that was it, there was no way out.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:43.240]   I had to go into the theater.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.640]   I went and told my guidance counselor,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.100]   look, I don't wanna go to college.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.340]   I wanna go to New York City to become an actor.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:49.720]   He says, what do you know about acting?
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.620]   You've been in one play.
[00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:52.780]   You've got to go to a liberal arts college.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.220]   A Clearing in the Woods by Arthur Lorenz.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:04.220]   A period of adjustment.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.740]   This is an early Tennessee Williams play.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:09.000]   I guess Tennessee Williams, a fearful metaphor for marriage.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.520]   It takes place, they're just, they're newly married couple.
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.980]   They're living on an earthquake fault in Southern California.
[00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.840]   They've just moved into their house.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.060]   The house is always trembling.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.980]   And I'm playing the guy that just got married.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.160]   And I'm so nervous, I've got the incurable shakes
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.120]   with the Southern accent.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.160]   So I'm, uh, uh, uh, uh, like this all the time.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.860]   My teeth chattering, it was quite a role for me.
[00:11:29.860 --> 00:11:32.140]   It required a lot of muscle tension.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.500]   And at the time I fell in love with the producer's daughter
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.500]   who was nine years old.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.320]   It was at, this was at Orleans Arena Theater in Cape Cod.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.860]   It was Alison Argo.
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:43.280]   And we used to sleep together
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:45.360]   or she'd come into my bed and fall asleep there.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.620]   And then I would feel nervous after about an hour
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.320]   and take her to her bed,
[00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.500]   but she'd be straight out like a board, you know?
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.600]   And so I knew she was faking.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:57.280]   Now, 10 years after I went back
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.880]   to Orleans Arena Theater for a visit
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.800]   and Alison was still there, only she was 19.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.960]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.840]   Under Milkwood, I'll call this the second Under Milkwood.
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:12.000]   And it was done at Tufts Arena Theater
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.300]   directed by Donald Ritchie.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.880]   I didn't think he was a good director
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:18.280]   because he laughed at everything anyone did.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.620]   Like Woody the Woodpecker.
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.520]   Like that, as a matter of fact.
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:26.560]   Crabb's Last Tape, I did this at Smith College.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.120]   I was a resident actor up there.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.040]   I don't know, I feel very close to the play
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.640]   because I often work with a tape recorder
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.740]   and I often feel like Crabb, you know, the character.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:42.720]   Antigone, my mentor, Paul John Austin
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.200]   directed this at the Image Theater in Boston.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:49.320]   And his idea was to do a very, very classical Antigone
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   with the robes and everything.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.000]   And I was lucky enough to be cast in the chorus.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.080]   I was very excited to be working with these people.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:57.000]   And the way we did it, traditional chorus,
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.820]   something like Donald Duck's Nephews.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:03.160]   The first guy would go, wonders are nature.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   And then the next voice, we'd just be standing straight.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.000]   But none more wonderful than man.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And then mine was, the storm gray seas yield to his prows.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And that's about what, that's how I'd say it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.160]   And the guy in front of me was Paul Benedict,
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.440]   who is now plays the white guy next door
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.800]   to the Jeffersons that comes out every so often on the TV
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.040]   like a little cuckoo bird, you know,
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:24.960]   sometimes there, sometimes not.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.880]   And at this time that I was doing this,
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.080]   I was drinking a lot of terpenhydrate
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.120]   and anything was an excuse to drink a little
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.060]   if I just got a slight cold, you know.
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.620]   So I would, this particular night,
[00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.880]   I had mixed it with beer and I came in
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   and I was a little woozy, but it started
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:40.740]   and it went wonders are nature,
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.480]   but none more wonderful than man.
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:43.740]   And the whole room went yellow.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.880]   And I just went, passed out and my, you know,
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.360]   this went right over and my Greek robes
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.520]   and they carried me out real formal, real straight
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.840]   and laid me down outside in the hallway
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.700]   and said, you better go home, rest up.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.840]   The seagull, I was in two productions of this.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.300]   This one I'll call the first.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:05.540]   Paul John Austin, my mentor directed it.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:08.380]   The idea, it was an organic production of the seagull.
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.080]   It was an organic seagull and the idea was
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.760]   that everyone would wander around on stage for six months
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.200]   without setting any of the blocking, you see.
[00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:20.520]   And then, that it would just set itself, you see.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.320]   Something like the idea of the monkeys writing Shakespeare.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:28.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:28.880]   And it worked.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.840]   And I was playing Shamaray, the game's keeper,
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.200]   would have to go bravo, silver, a whole octave lower.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.400]   You know, you'd have to say that.
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:38.520]   And then, whenever I'm in any Russian play,
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.160]   it would always, I always get nervous
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.100]   when the names come up and I always think
[00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:43.040]   I'm gonna stumble.
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.400]   It's like I'm getting, going real fast on my bicycle
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.720]   before some quicksand, you know,
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.680]   and I begin to go faster and faster with my lines
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.880]   and begin to sweat and I go,
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.280]   "Don't you remember last time you were here,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.220]   "you shot this bird and asked me to have it stuffed,
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:00.160]   "Boris Alekselevich," you know.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:04.600]   And then, you kind of just stumble through it.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.840]   But we had this guy in there that was playing,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.400]   he goes, "No, no.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.000]   "I don't remember."
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.600]   No, we had this guy who was playing the doctor,
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.980]   my favorite role, Dr. Dorn,
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.500]   because he has some of those wonderful lines,
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.560]   "The angel of silence is flying over us," is my favorite.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.720]   And this guy was from Long Island.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.640]   I don't remember his name,
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.180]   but he would take the proper Chekhovian pauses
[00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:30.400]   and look up for this line.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.220]   He would go.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.200]   The angel of silence is flying over us.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.160]   Commune.
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:44.720]   This was done right here in the garage,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.120]   the performance group directed by Richard Schechner,
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.240]   right in this room.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:51.720]   It was a very risky production because Richard,
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.620]   what he did was the people who were in it
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.140]   didn't know whether they were characters or themselves.
[00:15:57.140 --> 00:15:59.800]   So it was a real kind of a hodgepodge mixture
[00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.760]   of where he was working from the personalities,
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.660]   but also doing some overlay of objective character.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.800]   For instance, while we were working from material
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.260]   from Thoreau, from Walden, from Melville, Moby Dick,
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:19.200]   from Shakespeare, The Tempest, from the Bible,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.720]   certain things from the Bible,
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.680]   and also from Life Magazine article
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.400]   on the supposed murder of Sharon Tate by Charles Manson.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:29.240]   That had not been proven yet.
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:30.520]   It had just come out.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.340]   And so it was a real soup.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:35.240]   And there was this guy who was playing the Manson figure
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.280]   who was in fact a bit of a redneck from Oklahoma.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:39.880]   So when he'd come out and do his stuff,
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.800]   which was based on his personality,
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.240]   and then there'd be a party afterwards,
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.820]   some woman would say, oh, I just love
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:47.020]   that mean old redneck you played in that play.
[00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.380]   You know, and you'd go, what redneck?
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:50.320]   You know, like this.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.060]   And it was a lot of confusion.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:54.820]   Bruce, I'll give you another example.
[00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:57.520]   Bruce White was a white magician from Minneapolis,
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.920]   and he was in it, and he was playing the Christ element.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:02.800]   He was in a loincloth in a big cider tub.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.760]   He got murdered in there.
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:05.760]   It was supposed to be Sharon Tate's swimming pool.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.180]   And he was a member of a Jesus commune over on Fourth Avenue.
[00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:10.980]   Now, they lived there for free in tents
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.940]   because there was no heat.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.060]   It was just a big loft,
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.260]   and they lived in these tents in this loft.
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:17.080]   And they would take over there,
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.900]   they'd take us the Holy Eucharist, they'd take LSD.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.880]   And the way the LSD would be delivered
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:24.540]   was on a piece of paper this big, but little dots.
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.700]   It was blotter acid, and each month would be a different,
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.460]   each time it would be a different color.
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.940]   Like it would be the light blue
[00:17:29.940 --> 00:17:31.580]   would be the spirit of Christ,
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:32.700]   and brown would be the body,
[00:17:32.700 --> 00:17:34.300]   then crimson would be the blood.
[00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:35.340]   And that's the way it would come,
[00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:36.600]   and it would be slipped under the door,
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.300]   and no one would be charged any money,
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.780]   and no one knew the guy's name that would bring it.
[00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:42.700]   So they would take this acid, and they'd go to God,
[00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.420]   and they'd be with God sometimes all night,
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:45.260]   three nights in a row,
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:47.280]   and come into rehearsals in the day.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:52.100]   Bruce would come into rehearsal a glow,
[00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:53.800]   and I wanted to know what was going on.
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:54.640]   I was really curious.
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:56.300]   I wanted some of it, whatever it was.
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.620]   And he told me what they were doing,
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.700]   that they were taking LSD,
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.120]   and I was real excited about that,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.160]   but I had been reading about LSD for years,
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.860]   because I always read years ahead of it
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:05.500]   before I do any action at all.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.860]   And I had heard that if you would add
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.060]   any schizophrenic tendencies not to toy with it,
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.260]   and I thought then that I was.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.100]   Later I found out it was just schizoid and Gemini.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.380]   You know, it was much different than being schizophrenic.
[00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:19.820]   So, somewhat.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:23.220]   And so what I did was I would try to get close to them,
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:26.020]   you see, but their idea was that they,
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:28.400]   see Richard Schechner wanted to have the play end
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.940]   with symbols of possibility, you see,
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:33.820]   because the play was so dark and so heavy
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.780]   that he wanted it to end on an up note,
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.740]   but he couldn't find any symbols of possibility
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.340]   in New York City in 1970.
[00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.160]   You see, he'd run out of ideas.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:44.140]   But the Jesus commune had an idea, you see.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:46.300]   They happened to have a group called the Trees
[00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.580]   that played divinely inspired music.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.760]   For instance, I'd go over there for dinner.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.780]   We'd have a little brown rice and vegetables
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:55.320]   and then some red zingatig and they'd get out
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:57.540]   the instruments, you know, penny whistles,
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.260]   tambourines, recorders, and even a harp.
[00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:01.700]   And we'd begin to play, you know,
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.520]   and Bruce's wife would finish this passage
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.800]   on the penny whistle and I'd go,
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:06.380]   "Oh, Jodie, that was beautiful."
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:08.920]   And she'd go, "I didn't do anything.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.900]   "I didn't do anything.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:12.840]   "It's just coming through me," you know.
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.480]   So what their idea was was that they were going
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:18.580]   to convert everyone in the group gradually
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.420]   to the Holy Eucharist, you see.
[00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.620]   And then they would go to Christ
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.980]   and we'd be open to this idea.
[00:19:24.980 --> 00:19:26.980]   They wanted to convert Richard Schechner, finally,
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.340]   from Judaism to Christianity.
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.700]   A noble project, I thought,
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.380]   and it was as good as doing the play,
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:35.140]   but you couldn't do the play and that both, you know.
[00:19:35.140 --> 00:19:36.920]   Now, once we were all converted,
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:38.780]   the plan was that the garage door here,
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:40.720]   this is a big metal door at the end of the room,
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:42.900]   this door would open and they would all be
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:44.460]   this divinely inspired music group.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.920]   The trees would be on a float outside the garage
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:50.520]   and they would be wheeled in playing the celestial music
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.960]   and that would be the end of the play.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.680]   That would be the symbols of possibility.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.620]   So they were gradually setting us up for the conversion.
[00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.060]   Now, I came on my own to Bruce and asked him
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:02.180]   if I could take some LSD because we finally ended up
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.200]   at New Paltz, at SUNY New Paltz in residence
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.980]   for the summer in '71 to work on this piece,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.460]   to work on Commune.
[00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:10.180]   And I thought, well, the country would be a good place
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.020]   to try it.
[00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:13.100]   So keeping with the idea of being schizophrenic,
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.700]   I thought I'd take just a half a tab to start out.
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:18.720]   And after I took it, I said to Bruce, you know,
[00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:20.080]   maybe we should go up to the woods.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.620]   And he said, oh, why do you wanna do that?
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:23.200]   And I thought, oh, oh, he's gonna wanna read to me
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.340]   from the Bible, you know, that's what I was nervous about.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:26.760]   So I thought maybe I should have talked to him
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.580]   before I took the LSD.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:30.660]   But as it turned out, he said, anything you say,
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.740]   we'll go up to the woods.
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.400]   We got up to High Falls and I walked out onto this,
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.940]   I was starting to get dark and I walked down on the stream,
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:41.260]   I stood out on a rock and I went, I am.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:42.180]   Nothing happened.
[00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:45.500]   So I did it again, I am.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.620]   A little louder, you know, I just hear myself.
[00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:50.180]   And I thought I was disturbing the other campers.
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:52.400]   So I decided to go back and speak with Bruce.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.340]   And I got back, it was already almost dark
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:56.740]   and a bat flew over, you know, and I looked up
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.300]   and then 100 bats flew over with peacock feathers
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.340]   coming out of their tails a yard long.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.660]   You know, I said, Bruce, this is incredible.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:05.940]   This is incredible stuff, but what if?
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.520]   I was always there with the what ifs.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.560]   What if we are on 8th Street tripping, you see,
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.580]   with all the hippies there, what would that be like?
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:14.160]   And just as I said that, as though it was programmed,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.480]   15 hippies from 8th Street came out of the bushes
[00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:17.740]   with hatchets, you know?
[00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:22.220]   And they looked at us and they saw we were tripping,
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:24.000]   I don't know how they knew, I guess they saw our faces
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.280]   were blue, I don't know, but they saw that we were
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:28.940]   and they started to do this game where they would go around
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.880]   with the hatchets chopping exposed roots of trees,
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.060]   going, ah, ah, that's the fifth poisonous snake
[00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:37.180]   we've killed tonight, like this, you know?
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.340]   But this wasn't bothering me at all
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.100]   because I was so high on the LST
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.980]   that I was just seeing it as roots and hatchets
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:47.280]   and guys having a good time, but my,
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:51.940]   my friend Stephen, my friend Stephen Snow,
[00:21:51.940 --> 00:21:54.360]   he hadn't gotten up that high yet on it or whatever
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:56.300]   and he was seeing snakes because he was seeing,
[00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.940]   he was hallucinating on rattlesnakes
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.520]   because he thought Patrick Epstein,
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.940]   Susan Belinda Moonshine, you see,
[00:22:00.940 --> 00:22:03.100]   Richard Schechner asked everyone to change their names
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:04.740]   and just like the real communes,
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:06.940]   everyone changed their name except Bruce White and I,
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:10.100]   Patrick Epstein changed yours to Susan Belinda Moonshine
[00:22:10.100 --> 00:22:11.460]   and she was down by the water,
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:13.460]   tripping down by the pond and down by the stream
[00:22:13.460 --> 00:22:16.220]   and she disappeared and Stephen thought she had drowned
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.180]   and he kept telling me, I think Patrick's drowned.
[00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.080]   I said, it didn't matter.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.380]   (audience laughing)
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.420]   It just didn't matter and I knew, I had nothing to do with it
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:26.660]   and there's no way I could control it
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.500]   and what was going on was what was going on
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.100]   and these hippies were leading us to the road.
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:33.300]   You see, we have a loss, it was pitch dark
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.460]   and they led us out onto the road
[00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:38.820]   and I looked up and there was no moon and no clouds
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.660]   and only stars, totally unmediated.
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:42.860]   For the first time in my life,
[00:22:42.860 --> 00:22:45.740]   I just saw the stars as the thing in itself.
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.340]   There was no idea about them,
[00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:48.900]   there was no context about them
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.540]   and I went down on my knees.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.120]   I couldn't believe it and I said,
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:53.960]   Bruce, drive me down to the edge of this cliff.
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.420]   I wanna look over the valley
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.180]   and he let me out of this Oldsmobile
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.620]   and I stood there and the entire valley of New Paltz
[00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.580]   was pulsing like this and my whole body emptied out.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.620]   It was just an outline, like a Matisse drawing
[00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:07.380]   and a valley was breathing and floating through my head
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:09.100]   and floating through my body like that.
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.800]   I like this very much.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.180]   And I got in the car and I said,
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.420]   Bruce, what if, what if we're in Vietnam tripping now?
[00:23:17.420 --> 00:23:18.660]   And just as I said that,
[00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:22.020]   I saw all my thoughts coming up like a gondola,
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.020]   the gondolas on a Ferris wheel and going by,
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:25.220]   I could see them, I could read them,
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.580]   I could stop the wheel or I could let them go by.
[00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.800]   And we get down into New Paltz and Bruce said,
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.980]   now come on up to my room,
[00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:32.840]   I'm going to read to you from the Bible.
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:34.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.780]   It didn't matter, the pages were floating like this
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:37.660]   and there was no wind
[00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:40.060]   and Patrick Susan Belinda Moonshine Epstein was there
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.220]   and she hadn't drowned.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:46.900]   Now a little later, Bruce decided to do a seance
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:49.360]   on the anniversary of the death of Sharon Tate
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.660]   in order to call her spirit back.
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:54.860]   Asked us all to hold hands and to call her spirit back
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:57.680]   but to first empty our bodies out and empty our minds.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.520]   Well, I had that happen on the LSD
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.520]   so it happened automatically, just like a thermometer
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.840]   going up, out it went until the top of my head
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.400]   was this pyramid with gray ashes in it
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.280]   and I couldn't get the ashes out.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.240]   And I thought, gee, I don't know,
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.060]   everything's emptying out fast with these ashes,
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.420]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:16.300]   Then I thought, I don't know if I want Sharon Tate's
[00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.140]   spirit in my body, no, not really.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:22.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.900]   So it didn't happen and Bruce was real upset,
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.700]   he said, you know you guys, you should have emptied out
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.900]   all the way and let in because I was really calling
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.680]   the spirit of Christ and I knew you'd rather
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.280]   have Sharon Tate than Christ, so here.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.860]   He was a trickster.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:41.060]   You know, many things were going on, cryptic days of LSD.
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.100]   We weren't taking what everyone in the audience was
[00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:45.980]   and they thought we were peaking at the same time they were.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:48.140]   Like at Goucher College, we performed there
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:50.460]   and some women came up afterwards and touched our feet
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:54.960]   and said, you know, don't you, you know, you know.
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:56.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:00.180]   You know, cryptic messages in the clouds,
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:02.980]   in the grass, in the beetles, the long and winding road
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.820]   being the long and winding road of our success
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.780]   of our tour back to New York City for a hit show,
[00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.380]   on and on and on.
[00:25:09.380 --> 00:25:11.980]   Joan McIntosh was playing Clementine, that was her name,
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.500]   the name she chose, she was putting on a straw hat
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.700]   for the role, it was the first time she dressed up,
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.180]   she was in a bedroom up in New Paltz and someone said,
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.060]   turn on the radio, we'll have some music.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:22.260]   And I turned on the radio and it was,
[00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.860]   oh my darling, Clementine.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:27.380]   Everyone went, oh wow, this is gonna be a hit, you know.
[00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:29.220]   Now, along about this time,
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:33.500]   along about this time, we were asked to go to a nunnery
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:36.980]   in Darien to help revitalize the Catholic rituals
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.640]   because they felt that it would take a theater company
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:44.780]   to put a little more imagery back into some of the rituals
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.500]   and one of the rituals was to be the Stations of the Cross
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.500]   and the marriage ceremony and the Feast of the Immac
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   and the Conception and we were to go up there.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.600]   Now, Bruce was very nervous because he was afraid
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.300]   Christ wouldn't appear to him in the raw, you know,
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.000]   without LSD and he thought that it would be a challenge.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.160]   Now, we got up there and the priest started saying,
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.000]   he gave us a lecture.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.080]   He said, in the old days in the Catholic religion,
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.980]   taking the Eucharist was such a vital act
[00:26:05.980 --> 00:26:08.320]   that people actually had visions of Christ
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.000]   when they were doing it and Bruce was there
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.240]   in his fry boots, you know, kind of rolling his hair
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.860]   and his leather pants, having gone to Christ many times,
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.500]   smiling back at the priest.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.140]   Now, we did the Stations of the Cross
[00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.780]   and everyone chose an X but the priest had put
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:24.860]   too many X's in and Jesus was left over in the hat
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.580]   and everyone went, oh, wow, you know.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.480]   And then Patricia Bower got Jesus and she was the one
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:32.140]   that was actually persecuted in the place.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.040]   Everyone said, wow, again, you see.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:37.100]   Then we had the marriage ceremony and then a few wows later,
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.800]   we had the Feast of the Immaculate Conception
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.060]   and in which everyone had to go under the table
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:44.460]   and anoint each other's feet with olive oil, you know,
[00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:45.300]   before the dinner.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.640]   It was just a chicken and red wine.
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.780]   The only person that wouldn't go under was Richard Schechner
[00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:53.180]   who said that he would go under after he ate
[00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:56.180]   and he never went under.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.100]   So we toured this.
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:00.240]   We took it to Poland.
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:02.640]   Many things happened with the commune.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.940]   In Poland, they wanted to see it so badly.
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.120]   They didn't care what it was but it was American, you see,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.260]   and they call it the American spectacle.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:12.020]   And in Warsaw, they rioted and had to call a riot squad.
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:13.780]   There were thousands of people in the street
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.840]   and about 400 of them came around in the back
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:17.420]   and bent the bars on the men's room
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.140]   and came into the middle of the performance
[00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:20.460]   and we had to stop it, you know.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:22.540]   They swarmed in and pushed this door open.
[00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.540]   And in Wrocław, they would jump over our guards
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:26.540]   that we had at the door.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.900]   We'd have six people at the door.
[00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:30.100]   They'd take a running start and dive over them
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.060]   and then scramble up these 15-foot high curtains, you see,
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:34.900]   and hang there like monkeys.
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.780]   Oh, you could throw a wrench at them or something
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.660]   but you could never get them down.
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.820]   In France, you know, Richard Schechner required
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:44.260]   that everyone take their shoes off before they came
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.520]   into the space.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.020]   And in France, it was the only problem we had.
[00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.180]   In France, they were stealing boots, but not pears.
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.500]   They'd take one left boot.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.580]   (audience laughing)
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.700]   It was perverse materialism, you know.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:02.140]   One right boot and we'd end up spending $200 a night
[00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:04.680]   in France on buying new boots for the French.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:09.500]   The cocktail party.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   This was organized by John Winnevens.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.980]   You may, some of you may know him.
[00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:14.900]   He was driven off the American stage
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.120]   for upstaging American actors.
[00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.500]   He claims that he was the nephew of Dame Edith Evans
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.540]   and he went quite mad.
[00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.960]   He was from Wales and he said Dylan Thomas told him
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.220]   the only way he'd ever be a man
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:26.140]   was to get a cottage for himself.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:30.040]   So he bought a little cottage in Saratoga Springs, New York.
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.700]   It didn't work, nothing didn't work.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.340]   So he organized a theater company up there
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:35.020]   called the New World Theater.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:37.500]   And they were an amateur group and the way they do plays
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.700]   is they get together and drink sherry, you see.
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:42.780]   And then they say, "Oh, let's do a way of the world."
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:44.240]   And they do it in a week.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:45.740]   "Oh, let's do under Milkwood."
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.580]   They do it.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:47.620]   "Oh, let's do 'Tis Pity She's a Whore.'"
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:48.460]   They do it.
[00:28:48.460 --> 00:28:49.740]   And they said, "Let's do the cocktail party."
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:50.840]   They did it in a week.
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.780]   They'd learn their lines while they drank sherry.
[00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:55.220]   John Wynn Evans was playing Sir Henry Harcourt Riley.
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.100]   We were playing this for a sea of nuns,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.660]   a nunnery in Albany.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.140]   We came out in this great black sea of nuns
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:04.060]   and John Wynn Evans is so high on sherry,
[00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.900]   he's talking all the time with this line.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.140]   He says a few lines in the first act and he goes,
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.160]   "Well, that's all I have to say.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.900]   "Does anyone else have anything to say?"
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:13.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.380]   We just pulled the curtain down on him,
[00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.020]   took him down, threw him in a cold shower,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.940]   brought him up, and we finished the next two acts
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.260]   and the nuns loved it.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:24.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:26.260]   The reluctant debutante,
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:28.320]   Back Bay Community Theater, Boston.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.940]   The world of Shalom Alekhine.
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:39.100]   The Alley Theater, run by nine events.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.140]   Queen of the regional theaters in Houston, Texas,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.500]   known as Big Nines.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.480]   I mean, there was gossip.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.060]   People would put her down in the dressing room
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.700]   and this, because in like any theater,
[00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:49.840]   you'll find this in any theater happening all the time.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.500]   People making cracks about the director,
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.180]   particularly if she's a woman.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:56.660]   And this, the Alley Theater, people would say,
[00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:57.780]   because they've been there a long time,
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:29:59.920]   nine events, they had all the men's balls
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:03.020]   in a jar of formaldehyde, used them as a doorstop, you know?
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:06.120]   And now, I think there was a lot of animosity with her
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.900]   because she used to be an English teacher
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:10.420]   and she would give quizzes to her actors and actresses
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:11.660]   at the end of the season.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:14.220]   How many of you noticed the old man out back
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.060]   and what does he eat?
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.860]   You know, fill in the blank, you know, this kind of thing.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:23.860]   Now, one of the things that was happening
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.820]   in a regional theater or any theater is that
[00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:28.980]   when you're in the dressing room, you don't have a big role.
[00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:30.760]   You spend most of your time looking at yourself
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.380]   in the mirror and pretty soon, you know,
[00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:34.500]   you just got your makeup mirror
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:35.780]   and pretty soon you don't turn around
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.980]   and look at other people in the room.
[00:30:36.980 --> 00:30:39.080]   You talk to them through your mirror, you know?
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:41.900]   And pretty soon, you're talking to yourself,
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.100]   even though you're dressing them
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.380]   and you're starting to watch the wrinkles on your face,
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:46.860]   how long your nose hairs are,
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:49.720]   whether or not your teeth need cleaning, how you're aging,
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:52.300]   you watch the smoke go in, it goes in blue,
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:55.580]   it comes out gray and so you have a real relationship
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.620]   with your face in the mirror most of the time
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:30:58.740]   down at the Alley Theater.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:00.740]   And Nina Vance would come in from say a trip
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.700]   to New York City where everyone was very threatened
[00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.220]   when she'd go to New York 'cause she was afraid
[00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:06.660]   that she'd find some new blood and she'd come back
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:08.420]   and there'd be a big stand-up mirror in the dressing room
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.020]   and she'd stand in front of that and primp
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.660]   while she talked to everyone in the theater.
[00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:13.100]   She had bright red hair.
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.060]   "Dear Hearts," she said, "There is absolutely nothing
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.280]   "going on in New York City that isn't going on down here
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.800]   "100 times better," you know?
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.620]   So one time she came in and Tom Toner,
[00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:22.500]   who was the character actor, was talking about her
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:24.340]   and referring to her as Big Nines.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.480]   And he said, "And then we were walking in in Big Nines
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:29.940]   "and she walked in and he had in Big 10s and Big 11s
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.940]   "and Big 12s and I won," you see?
[00:31:31.940 --> 00:31:33.700]   And then she started primping in front of the mirror
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:35.220]   and saying, "Dear Hearts, there's nothing."
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   Anyway, to make a long story short, I was playing,
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:41.820]   I was suffering myself still in my masochistic period.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.020]   I was a vegetarian and I was not a good cook of a vegetarian.
[00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:48.740]   I was eating only soybeans, you see?
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.620]   Flavored with a little bay leaf, that's all I was eating.
[00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.620]   And this was causing enormous gas, enormous gas, you see?
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:01.880]   And I was playing an angel and I had to enter, you see?
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:06.020]   Four angels had to come in and give a bayonce
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.380]   to a bunch of schwag because he was so humble on Earth.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.280]   And I had 15 minutes in the wings and my angel robes
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.640]   were weighted with lead weights
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.260]   to keep them on the ground, you see?
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:18.540]   So this enormous gas built up under the angel's robe.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.900]   And then after 15 minutes, I would enter like
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.080]   Cardinal Bishop Fulton J. Sheen in Life is Worth Living,
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.140]   you see, and these magenta brown gas balls
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.580]   were coming up under the robe.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.460]   The other angels were weeping.
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:33.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.940]   The Tower of Babel or Babel.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.220]   Tony Abeson, a devoted Grotowski follower.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.540]   He devoted to Grotowski, trained with him in Southern France
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.560]   and had a thing called the Ensemble Theater Laboratory
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.040]   over in West 19th Street, I was a member of.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.780]   Tony was quite a purist, only dressed in black.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.340]   I only think he had one black outfit,
[00:32:54.340 --> 00:32:56.820]   black pants, a black turtleneck.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:01.220]   Only drank pure Polish vodka and I don't know what he ate.
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:03.180]   I think back, I never remember seeing him eating.
[00:33:03.180 --> 00:33:04.900]   The first thing that comes to mind is a box
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:08.760]   of Hart's Mountain Birdseed, but I know he didn't eat that,
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.540]   but that's what pops into my head, I see that.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:13.000]   And we would go over there, you see,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.980]   here's who our ritual would be in the morning.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.020]   We'd get there, we'd come into the room, it would be dark.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.040]   And we'd lie on the floor in that room for an hour.
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:24.340]   And just listening to the trucks out on 19th Street.
[00:33:24.340 --> 00:33:25.940]   And it was real relaxing.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:27.960]   And then after that hour, the lights would come up
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:30.940]   just a little bit and everyone would start thrashing,
[00:33:30.940 --> 00:33:32.500]   like, you know, like fish out of water,
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:33.660]   beating their head on the floor
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:36.180]   and moaning like, "Oh, ah!"
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.820]   Now, I've often found it difficult
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.380]   to find the motivation for that,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.340]   but if you didn't find it,
[00:33:41.340 --> 00:33:43.020]   you'd soon be hit by someone doing it.
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:46.280]   So it would set you off, just like a chain reaction,
[00:33:46.280 --> 00:33:49.180]   you know, and then the lights would come up a little higher
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:50.740]   and we'd all encounter each other
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.540]   by looking in each other's faces
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.800]   and touching each other's faces for an hour.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:56.980]   And now after six months of this,
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.700]   Tony decided, a la Grotowski and Todaport Theater,
[00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.380]   to do a biblical production, you know,
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.700]   to adapt the Tower of Babel,
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.740]   in which mankind tries to build this great tower to God.
[00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:10.180]   And it goes so high that it's a pride problem
[00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:12.340]   and they get knocked down, their language gets confounded.
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.440]   They go to all different parts of the world
[00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.840]   talking different languages.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:17.220]   Now, here's what it would be.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:20.660]   We'd come out of these different cracks in the little room
[00:34:20.660 --> 00:34:22.820]   and we'd all be in unison going,
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:26.460]   hum, all one common language, you know?
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:29.060]   And then we'd start to build this tower out of our bodies.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:30.540]   You know, well, it never went very high
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.180]   'cause only five of us in the ceiling was very low.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.620]   So it was kind of like grabbing and holding on
[00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:38.300]   and people falling off people and it was very awkward.
[00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.740]   And then it would finally collapse out of whatever.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:42.980]   We never found the motivation.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.540]   And everyone would go away going,
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:48.540]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.580]   You know, and all the languages were confounded.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.780]   Now, somehow, and I don't know how this happened,
[00:34:53.780 --> 00:34:58.580]   we were invited to play this at Missouri grade schools.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:02.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.020]   I don't know how it happened.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.340]   We got there and it was incredible.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:08.500]   It was like a Winslow Homer painting.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.640]   These dirt school yards, the kids in the windows like this.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.860]   They told the actors were coming and the actresses.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:18.940]   And we got there and we went into the cafeteria
[00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:22.640]   and we started out, hum.
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.380]   And as soon as we started to build this tower of Babel,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:28.860]   this body pile, the whole room, all the kids,
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.540]   and I want you to take this word at its most profoundest,
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:32.960]   went mad.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.400]   And I think to this day, some of them are still mad.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.700]   They were spinning in circles and they were out of control.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.500]   They went and the teachers couldn't stop them.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.540]   It was, I want to say it was like a National Guard situation
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:48.820]   and the teachers threw us out of the school immediately,
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.360]   stopped the show, stopped the show.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.620]   They called St. Louis and they had a board
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.100]   of women's artists interrogation,
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.700]   a women's community interrogation of us.
[00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.900]   We were banned from, we were driven out of St. Louis
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:04.780]   on the grounds, and our contract was not honored,
[00:36:04.780 --> 00:36:08.060]   on the grounds that A, we were building flesh piles
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:10.200]   for grade school students.
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:14.900]   And B, that our leotards had little holes in them.
[00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.980]   You could see the flesh.
[00:36:17.980 --> 00:36:19.740]   You know how they get those little ribs?
[00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:23.080]   Oh, we came back to New York City in a state of shame.
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.060]   We never opened the play.
[00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:33.480]   We bombed in New Haven.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.420]   I did this at Williamstown Summer Theater.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:37.220]   I was supposed to get really angry.
[00:36:37.220 --> 00:36:38.040]   I was the major.
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.740]   I couldn't do it because the guy I was supposed
[00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.260]   to get angry with was a working actor in soap operas.
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:44.860]   So I was intimidated by him 'cause I hadn't any work then.
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.980]   I'd have to go like this, "You see this?
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:48.320]   "You know what it is?"
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.980]   He'd go, "It's a hand."
[00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:51.620]   I'd go, "No, it's a fist."
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:54.260]   But I always heard myself, I was always self-conscious.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:56.780]   So when the play, We Bomb New Haven came from New York City,
[00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:59.780]   I decided I would try out for it as one of the idiots.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:01.620]   Now, there were about five of them running around
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.020]   in a jockstrap, you know?
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:05.940]   And so I went down to try out an open call.
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:07.540]   You see that jam, but no one was there.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.540]   It was in the catacombs of Lincoln Center.
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:12.980]   And I went down and it was the stage manager of this play.
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.140]   We Bomb New Haven in the cinder block room.
[00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:16.880]   He said, "Come in, come in.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.220]   "How's your body?"
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.580]   I said, "Oh, it's pretty good."
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:23.700]   This was some time ago, you know, it was years ago.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:27.560]   He said, "Well, I'd like to have a look, you know?
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.380]   "You gotta be in good shape."
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.580]   Now, I don't know how this happened.
[00:37:30.580 --> 00:37:31.400]   I don't remember.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.020]   This is the only amnesia I had in the stories.
[00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:36.040]   Next thing I knew, I was down doing push-ups naked.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.920]   I mean, maybe he hypnotized me, I don't know.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.540]   All my clothes was in a pile.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:42.500]   Into my seventh push-up, I began to feel,
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:45.020]   "Hey, this is a little weird."
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:46.460]   And I felt the weirdness of it,
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:48.140]   and I scrambled for my underwear,
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.520]   only I put them on backwards
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.900]   so the fly was around in my ass, you know?
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:56.900]   And he said, "Your underwear's on backwards."
[00:37:56.900 --> 00:37:59.020]   He just washed the whole thing, you know?
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:01.040]   I said, "Oh, that's all right, I just lift the leg,
[00:38:01.040 --> 00:38:03.100]   "you know, don't worry about it."
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.260]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:07.300]   And I went home, I got out
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.420]   my Actors' Equity Association Handbook, you know,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.780]   and I looked up nudity right away.
[00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:13.420]   I said, "Nudity at auditions may be permitted
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.800]   "only under the following guidelines.
[00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.220]   "When an equity stage manager
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:19.700]   "or official equity representative is present."
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.720]   So they were okay, they were awesome.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:25.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:28.100]   Wind in the Willows, this is a great book.
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:31.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.660]   Tom Paine, my first big off-Broadway break
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.900]   directed by Tom O'Hogan,
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.340]   I replaced Jerry Cunliffe in the original cast,
[00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:40.340]   and the way I did it was to lock arms
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:42.100]   and just do it like Balinese dances
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.180]   where Jerry would say something,
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:45.380]   I'd say just what he said and sing everything he said
[00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.100]   and move just like he moved, so it was total osmosis.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.940]   And they got me into the role in a week
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.420]   and Tom O'Hogan kept saying, "Go on tonight."
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.420]   I said, "I couldn't go on.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:55.460]   "I haven't had time to buy my ballet shoes."
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.780]   He said, "Where Jerry's?"
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:39:00.060]   Said, "Jerry wears size nine, I wear 11 1/2D."
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.660]   So Tom says, "Hey, come on," you know?
[00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.860]   And I didn't want to offend him.
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:05.500]   I was trying to work my way up in the theater,
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.180]   so I went on, I played the whole thing,
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:09.340]   two hours and my feet were like this, you know?
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.900]   I lost both toenails, they never came in right.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:14.820]   Now I was playing this show for eight,
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:16.140]   I was playing it six months,
[00:39:16.140 --> 00:39:19.140]   eight performances a night for $75 a week,
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.620]   and it was really starting to get to me.
[00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:23.660]   And one of the things that I started to do
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.540]   was keep a little brandy out in the wings.
[00:39:25.540 --> 00:39:26.900]   Now it was an ensemble piece,
[00:39:26.900 --> 00:39:28.860]   we were on the stage all the time,
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:30.540]   but I did have one chance to come out
[00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:33.020]   and change into my diaphanous see-through robe
[00:39:33.020 --> 00:39:34.960]   where we go out for the hallucination scene,
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.600]   and I'd have this brandy in the wings,
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.460]   and as I was changing, I'd just belt it down
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:40.140]   and come sailing out in these robes
[00:39:40.140 --> 00:39:41.780]   for the hallucination scene, you know?
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.620]   Pretty soon I began to think I'm getting too much
[00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:45.460]   like John Barrymore on the drinking side,
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.820]   and I really gotta get out of this thing.
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:49.860]   Everyone said, you wanna quit an off-Broadway show?
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:51.680]   You never do that, they said.
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:53.300]   And you've got a good year of touring
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:54.980]   and then a couple of years of college tours
[00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:56.180]   out of this baby, you know?
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.120]   You could really live off it for a while.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.780]   But I decided to quit, and I thought,
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.140]   this would be the time to get an agent, you know?
[00:40:02.140 --> 00:40:04.260]   Because I had been in a big off-Broadway play,
[00:40:04.260 --> 00:40:05.780]   so I started reading about agents.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.940]   I read for a little bit before I went into it
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:09.780]   on how to select an agent.
[00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.100]   It says, help your agent interview you.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.980]   Tell him about your career, your desires,
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.560]   your commitment, your training,
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.640]   what you feel you can do,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.860]   and what sacrifices you're prepared to make.
[00:40:19.860 --> 00:40:21.580]   Answer his questions truthfully.
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:23.140]   An agent is like a lawyer.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.040]   You have to trust him completely.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.140]   If there is any lying to be done about your career,
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.540]   you will want him to do it for you.
[00:40:29.540 --> 00:40:32.340]   Do not presume to know more than he does
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:34.540]   about show business, even if you think you do.
[00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:36.380]   Terminate the interview when you think you've said
[00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:38.060]   and asked everything on your mind.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.540]   Some people don't know when to stop talking,
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:40.940]   and some agents don't know how to get people
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:42.160]   out of their office.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.180]   Offer to leave when you sense the interview is over
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.660]   and go home or go see a movie.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.160]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.580]   If he wants you, he will let you know
[00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:54.320]   either by grabbing you before you leave the office
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:57.460]   (audience laughs)
[00:40:57.460 --> 00:40:58.660]   or by calling you later.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:41:01.480]   Your task is to simply keep trying
[00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.980]   until someone grabs you.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.780]   Now, all right, my agent never grabbed me.
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:08.040]   He sat there, the phone kept ringing,
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:09.740]   and then he'd talk on the phone.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:11.020]   He looked back at me and said,
[00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:13.060]   oh, now what was it we were talking about?
[00:41:14.180 --> 00:41:17.100]   (audience laughs)
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.420]   Caucasian Chalk Circle.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:20.520]   I did this at Williamstown Summer Theater.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.460]   The apprentices were always, I was playing Aztec,
[00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:25.740]   and the apprentices were always trying to get me stoned
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.180]   on hash before I'd go on.
[00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:29.660]   I'd say, no, no, I never perform on drugs.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:32.220]   I never have, despite what the New York Times said
[00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:34.060]   about me doing the Seagull on LSD.
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.780]   Sounds like a good story, but it didn't happen.
[00:41:36.780 --> 00:41:38.980]   So I would go on straight, and I would do Aztec,
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.700]   and then once I took the hashish afterwards,
[00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:44.740]   and they said, now do you wanna go to Hojo's?
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:46.380]   I said, no, I wanted to go out,
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:48.420]   and I lay down on this field, and I looked up,
[00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:49.780]   and for the first time in my life,
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:51.980]   I looked out at the stars and set it up.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.860]   It lasted about 30 seconds, and I couldn't get it back.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:56.340]   I never had been able to get it back.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.080]   I caught a wicked cold from lying in the wet grass.
[00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:02.620]   (audience laughs)
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:03.460]   The Physicists.
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.140]   This was done at the Alley Theater in Houston, Texas.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:08.020]   The three guys that played the Physicists,
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:09.700]   this is in an insane asylum also.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.260]   They had to play, they thought they were Newton, Einstein,
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.100]   and other Physicists.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.260]   They'd have to eat (speaks in foreign language)
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:18.300]   every night, which was this wonderful chicken
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:21.360]   with mushroom sauce, and Nine Advanced had it sent over
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.180]   from one of the best restaurants in Houston,
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:25.500]   and they got sick of it for the six-week run,
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:27.760]   so they would just take a few pokes at it
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.100]   and talk most of the time.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.660]   They'd send it back to the dressing room
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:31.580]   where I wouldn't eat.
[00:42:31.580 --> 00:42:33.780]   You see, I'd wait for it to be sent back like a dog
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.700]   in front of my mirror, 'cause I,
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.140]   see, I just had a small roll.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.940]   I was a butler in this insane asylum,
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.060]   so most of the time, I was sitting in front of my mirror
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:44.460]   watching my nose hairs grow, and they'd bring in the,
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.060]   they'd bring in the (speaks in foreign language)
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:48.660]   and I'd watch myself eat that.
[00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:49.820]   It was fun.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:53.380]   So afterwards, I would go hang out with the Houston locals
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:55.900]   and we would smoke hemp, marijuana,
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.100]   and there was a lot of it around.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.140]   It was very good then.
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:42:59.420]   At least it had a good effect on me.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.340]   We'd listen to Revolver and The Velvet Underground,
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:04.500]   and once I thought the marijuana was so good
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.260]   because it was such a time thing with one of these very,
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:08.700]   made the song sound very long,
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.260]   Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands,
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:13.220]   and I found out that it was, in fact, quite long afterwards
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:15.780]   when I looked at the record itself, you know.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.180]   So I got confused.
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:20.380]   But anyway, for instance, after about two in the morning,
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:21.780]   we'd all be smoking with the Houston,
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:22.940]   I'd be with the Houston locals.
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.620]   Joe Pritchard would go out to the kitchen.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.700]   He'd come back with a plate of toast cut in triangles,
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:32.300]   and everyone would go, "Oh, far out toast."
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:35.220]   (audience laughs)
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.180]   And they'd go for the triangles, you know,
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.780]   and they'd take the toast off the plate,
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.300]   and there would be 10 fried eggs hidden under the bread,
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:45.980]   and everyone would go, "Oh, eggs, Joe, far out."
[00:43:45.980 --> 00:43:47.880]   Someone told me recently,
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:51.260]   someone from the old gang of Houston moved up to New York
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.440]   and said, "Do you remember Jamie,
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:56.340]   "who was always lying in a hammock getting stoned,
[00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:58.520]   "and he couldn't figure out whether he wanted to be a doctor
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:01.340]   "or go to South America and be stoned all the time?"
[00:44:01.340 --> 00:44:03.020]   I said, "Yeah, I remember him."
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:05.260]   She said, "Well, he did both."
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:06.360]   I said, "What do you mean he did both?"
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.440]   She said, "He was the doctor at Jonestown
[00:44:08.440 --> 00:44:10.160]   "that administered the Kool-Aid."
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:16.380]   Thomas with Two Souls, a religious play.
[00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:22.620]   I Am a Camera, I played Christopher Isherwood.
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:29.820]   Diary of Anne Frank, I played Mr. Van Damme with padding.
[00:44:29.820 --> 00:44:35.740]   Under Milkwood, the third production was done
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:39.500]   at the YMHA in Schenectady in August during a heat wave.
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:42.540]   We call it the slag heat, no air conditioning.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:44.240]   John Winnevins was in it crazy.
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:45.080]   He'd flip out.
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:46.040]   I was directing it.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:49.020]   He would just disappear, and he would go down.
[00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:51.220]   When he'd get so tense, he couldn't stand it any longer.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.500]   He would go down to the men's room
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.700]   in the Greyhound station in Schenectady
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:56.780]   and work something out in the urinals.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:44:57.620]   I don't know.
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:44:59.160]   I guess it was the only place he felt comfortable
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.740]   with the urinals, and he would come back,
[00:45:00.740 --> 00:45:02.380]   and then we would go on with the play,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:04.140]   and then we would drive to Saratoga Springs
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:05.840]   where we were staying in a house for free,
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.060]   a Victorian house, and have a little Andre champagne
[00:45:08.060 --> 00:45:09.060]   with a strawberry in it.
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:11.800]   He'd get high and go off and raid the Saratoga mansions
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:12.980]   that had been closed up for years,
[00:45:12.980 --> 00:45:15.180]   get the antiques, come back, pile 'em up,
[00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.480]   fill his cottage with them.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:27.740]   This represents Macbeth, this cod,
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:31.480]   and Macbeth is a very dangerous play.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.040]   There are three things in theater
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:34.720]   that are major superstitions.
[00:45:34.720 --> 00:45:36.740]   One is no whistling in the dressing room.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:38.620]   The other is no green sets.
[00:45:38.620 --> 00:45:40.740]   And the third is do not quote from Macbeth,
[00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.900]   particularly the witches.
[00:45:41.900 --> 00:45:45.660]   The witches, they think that it actually can bring back
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:48.700]   and incantate evil spirits by doing this.
[00:45:48.700 --> 00:45:51.380]   Now, I was involved in one production of it,
[00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:52.260]   the performance group,
[00:45:52.260 --> 00:45:54.780]   and they broke up violently around it.
[00:45:54.780 --> 00:45:57.860]   And this guy, Ernie Shank, quit with four days notice.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:58.880]   He'd been a member of the group,
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.460]   and Richard Checkner called me and asked me
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.380]   to come in as a mercenary in four days' time
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:04.780]   to learn my lines and do the role of Malcolm.
[00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:08.760]   And so Ernie Shank went off and became Mr. Peanut
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:11.060]   and toured around in a big peanut outfit.
[00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:14.880]   And I was learning my lines,
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.040]   but no one would come in to rehearse with me.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.940]   They were all treating me like a total mercenary,
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.140]   and they just would boycott me.
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:21.980]   They wouldn't speak to me.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:23.640]   It was a very uncomfortable situation,
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.800]   but it was nothing new for me.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.460]   Regional theater had always been like that,
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.120]   so I just thought it was another regional theater situation.
[00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:31.380]   I didn't know for a matter about groups.
[00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:34.020]   So I came in, and then Richard Checkner would play the role
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:36.580]   of the king, 'cause I had my main scene with the king.
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.940]   Now the king in the banquet scene would have to be eaten.
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:42.580]   The way Richard directed it was they'd suck his stomach.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.740]   That would be the meal.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:46.400]   So all of the sons and all the people would descend
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.780]   on the king and start sucking his stomach.
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.340]   So the guy that played the king had hickeys
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.140]   all over his stomach, you see?
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:55.720]   But Richard, he'd lay out there, and he'd lift his shirt,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.740]   and there'd be this huge hump, and he'd say, "Suck."
[00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.780]   And he'd say, "Harder, harder."
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:01.940]   Well, I mean, there's lots of things I'd do for a role,
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:04.140]   but this was finally the ultimate irony.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:07.300]   I was down there, and I'd come away
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.420]   after sucking his stomach,
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.020]   and my teeth would be filled with hair.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:12.420]   But I got the role, you see, in four days.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:15.580]   And now, this is a very dangerous play.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:19.540]   Someone was telling me recently that a man died
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:21.520]   that they knew at 28 years old.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.300]   In the production of this in Minneapolis,
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.860]   his heart burst while he was playing it
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.860]   and fell in the arms of one of the actors.
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.140]   And there had been, he was 28,
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:31.580]   and there was no history of any heart failure in his family.
[00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:38.340]   Under the Yum Yum Tree.
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:39.180]   Oh.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.180]   I have the text here.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:42.380]   I'm not gonna read to you.
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.100]   This was at Orleans Arena Theater.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:45.980]   This is where I really came up against it.
[00:47:45.980 --> 00:47:48.220]   I was always told in Stanislavski in training,
[00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:51.220]   you've always got to find something in a role that you love.
[00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.260]   Well, I had a week to do it,
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.780]   and I didn't make it with this one.
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:59.300]   I was playing a lawyer that wanted to make it
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.900]   with this woman, but she didn't want to do it
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.740]   until they got married,
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.860]   but she wanted to find out if they could be compatible
[00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:06.780]   and live together first without touching each other
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.060]   in Telegraph Hill in San Francisco.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:11.080]   So, I wasn't enjoying it a bit.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.940]   And the guy that was directing it,
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.800]   his name was Dennis Holley.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.420]   And he was from Rhode Island.
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:18.100]   And in fact, he was from Jerusalem, Rhode Island,
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:20.680]   and he was known as the Holley family from Jerusalem.
[00:48:20.680 --> 00:48:21.520]   They were.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:22.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:25.820]   And his father was also a judge in Providence.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:28.260]   And Dennis was saying, Gray,
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:30.300]   I come in with this heavy, long face.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:32.540]   He said, Gray, this is a comedy,
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:34.360]   and you haven't smiled once.
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:40.000]   Offiest Descending.
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.700]   This is an early Tennessee Williams play,
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.260]   also known as Battle of Angels.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.220]   We did this at the Catalina Gallery Theater
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.940]   in Saratoga, New York.
[00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:49.320]   A very unusual theater.
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.820]   Everyone was cast by John Winnevans,
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.500]   and he would cast people by, if he liked your looks,
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:48:56.660]   he would sit down with a glass of sherry in New York.
[00:48:56.660 --> 00:48:59.660]   And so, he liked the looks of about six different men.
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.320]   And we all got up there and all realized
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.980]   that we were all leading types.
[00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:04.380]   We could all play the same role.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:07.180]   So, he'd cast six leading men to come up to this theater.
[00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:10.260]   And there were a couple of women up there already,
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.700]   and we were living in a converted whorehouse
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:13.860]   with no furniture at all.
[00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:15.820]   We were sleeping on mattresses on the floor
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:18.860]   with silk ceilings and paisley wall-to-wall carpet.
[00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:20.540]   The ceilings were hanging down like this.
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:24.020]   And Lena Spencer was into seances then.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:24.940]   She'd stay up all night.
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:27.660]   There were lots of spirits in Saratoga, New York.
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:29.460]   And she would take a wine glass
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:30.940]   and wait for it to fill with a spirit.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.140]   And the way you could tell a spirit was going into it
[00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:34.900]   was it would fog up.
[00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.860]   And as it fogged up, she'd turn it over to catch it
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.700]   and then do the Ouija board.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.340]   The glass would jump up in the air and go wild.
[00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:43.740]   And I was there one night when a 16-year-old girl
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.560]   came back from the dead.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:46.880]   She died of leukemia.
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.200]   And she asked to hear, "Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man."
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:52.240]   And Lena got up and put it right on.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.480]   She had it handy.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:56.400]   And there was a guy, Duncan Gillespie,
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.080]   who was worshiping Luna on the roof at night.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.980]   He was a 60-year-old organist.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.320]   And he would go up naked with bedsheets wrapped around him
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.240]   and light candles.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.180]   And there were these other acts.
[00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.980]   I was trying to keep my sanity by having contact
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:11.520]   with the Skidmore College girls, women, women girls.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:15.860]   And also a schoolteacher up the street, Linda Hollingshead.
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:18.220]   Now Linda asked me one night if I would like to smoke
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.160]   a little very strong dope because her boyfriend,
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.540]   Jeff Royce, always flipped out.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.000]   So I said, "Oh, sure, bring it over."
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.200]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:27.200 --> 00:50:30.680]   So we went up to this third floor
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.940]   of the converted whorehouse, my bedroom, you know,
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.520]   and I took a couple of puffs and I looked out the window
[00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.880]   and I said, "Gee, Linda, what are those three nuns
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:39.480]   "in white doing bending over that puddle?
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:41.520]   "And when did it rain?"
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:43.380]   And she looked at me like I was crazy
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.660]   and I thought she had poisoned me, you see?
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.320]   And so I began to run through the converted whorehouse.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.560]   It was like a labyrinth.
[00:50:49.560 --> 00:50:51.600]   Each time I'd run into her, my pulse would go up
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   a little higher because I would freak out
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.460]   and it was up to 140, about 140.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:59.300]   And I asked John Winnevans to call the ambulance
[00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:01.200]   to take me to the hospital 'cause I thought
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.740]   I had overdosed on whatever it was.
[00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:05.080]   And he said, "Look, let's go for a walk."
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.480]   'Cause you don't have to go to the hospital yet.
[00:51:06.480 --> 00:51:08.840]   He walked me up Violet Street and as I was going
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:10.880]   up the hill, I looked across and I saw myself
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:12.760]   walking down the other side of the street.
[00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:14.560]   And this put my pulse up to 200.
[00:51:14.560 --> 00:51:16.920]   And John said, "You better go back and lie down.
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:19.620]   "I'll call Brian, he knows more about this stuff."
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.260]   So I went back and I climbed three flights of stairs.
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:24.160]   It took me about an hour, like a very old man.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:25.840]   I thought my heart was going to break.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:28.100]   I got up there and I lay down on my bed in my bedroom.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:30.840]   And as soon as I lay down, this movie began on the wall
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:34.280]   of these Quaker men, Amish men, like wind up Santa Clauses
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.680]   all dressed in black, leaning out of a screen door
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.480]   of a house going like this.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.820]   All the time, like this, like this.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.040]   And out the other screen door, they were carrying coffins.
[00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:45.820]   This is as fast as they could go, coffin, coffin, coffin,
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:48.560]   coffin, like beckon, coffin, beckon, coffin.
[00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:51.000]   And I was watching this movie and as I was watching it,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.960]   this mat that I had behind my head on the wall,
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.060]   like a Zen meditation mat, it came down
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:56.860]   and wrapped around my body like you carry
[00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.740]   the Vietnamese bodies in those straw caskets.
[00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:01.900]   And the entire bed began to shift and go up
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.840]   like one of those big guns on a battleship.
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:04.940]   And I couldn't move at all.
[00:52:04.940 --> 00:52:07.000]   I was in this bag and I was going down
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.740]   the barrel of this gun full speed ahead,
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:10.520]   like down a well or the barrel of a gun.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.220]   It was dark and I thought I was gonna die
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.980]   or just disappear into this darkness.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:15.740]   I couldn't move and I looked up at the end of the barrel
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:17.420]   and there was this pulsing diamond,
[00:52:17.420 --> 00:52:19.780]   this huge bright white light pulsing like this
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:21.720]   and it brought me right out of the barrel
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:23.660]   and I popped out and I realized it was just
[00:52:23.660 --> 00:52:25.180]   the streetlight on the wall, you see.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:27.100]   And then I heard this Duke Ellington record,
[00:52:27.100 --> 00:52:29.820]   big band finale that was stuck, like a stuck record,
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:34.040]   like ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.360]   But it wasn't ending, you know, I thought,
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.640]   oh God, Lena's got a stuck record downstairs.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.440]   I gotta go tell her, I'm going crazy.
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:41.080]   In order to get downstairs, I had to go
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.340]   through the bathroom, you see,
[00:52:42.340 --> 00:52:43.480]   and I went through the bathroom
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.180]   and I realized it was just the plumbing,
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:47.040]   it was just the water and the pipes.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.240]   (audience laughs)
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.440]   So I went back and I lay down, you know,
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.480]   and I heard the following sequence.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:58.320]   Went something like this, come in.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.360]   (knocks)
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.720]   It's Brian, who is it?
[00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.420]   And Brian came in and sat down on the bed
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:08.500]   and he nursed me through the night.
[00:53:08.500 --> 00:53:12.240]   Now, I recovered in about a week's time
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:14.340]   and shortly after that, Linda Hollings said,
[00:53:14.340 --> 00:53:16.740]   the same woman that gave me this grass said,
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.900]   "You know, if you're going to be down
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:20.180]   "in New York City in the weekend,
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:21.380]   "make sure you give me a call,
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:23.980]   "because I'm having an affair with one of the thugs
[00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:25.380]   "and they're geniuses, all of them.
[00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.280]   "This guy's a genius and you really should meet them.
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:28.480]   "They were living in the East Village."
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.680]   Now, I did come to New York City for the weekend,
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:32.460]   I was staying on West 54th Street,
[00:53:32.460 --> 00:53:33.920]   but I'd never been in the East Village,
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.860]   I'd never met the thugs, and I'd never met a genius.
[00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:39.060]   So I wanted to do all of this, you know,
[00:53:39.060 --> 00:53:43.660]   in one fell afternoon.
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:48.660]   So that day, my life changed.
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:51.840]   I went into extreme culture shock
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.380]   on the crosstown, Houston crosstown bus,
[00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:57.020]   saw things I never dreamed existed before.
[00:53:57.020 --> 00:53:58.220]   That was the end of Boston
[00:53:58.220 --> 00:53:59.580]   and that was the end of Rhode Island.
[00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:02.020]   There was no going home again, burnt out cars
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.420]   with Puerto Rican kids playing
[00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.020]   where the engines were supposed to have been
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:07.560]   and you can see it even worse now
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.500]   on 9th Street and Avenue D.
[00:54:09.500 --> 00:54:11.100]   And so when I got to the thugs house
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.200]   with 7th Street and Avenue C,
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.200]   they were all there reading Pogo comic books
[00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:17.600]   and drinking marijuana tea made from stems and seeds
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:18.900]   out of beer mugs, you know.
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:21.000]   So I joined in, I had one beer mug
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.280]   and then I had a couple of tokes on the marijuana cigarette
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:25.300]   and they went off to do their concert at Fillmore East.
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.180]   They went to prepare and Linda and I
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.240]   were wandering through the East Village.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.740]   Now, we got to Fillmore East and she was saying,
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:33.420]   "You're gonna really enjoy this concert
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:35.860]   "because they trip on acid whenever they perform."
[00:54:35.860 --> 00:54:38.220]   And the other night, they turned into alligators
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.760]   in front of each other, you know.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.920]   And I said, "Whoa, Linda," you know.
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:46.700]   And we got into the lobby,
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:51.700]   the East Village, Fillmore East.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:55.340]   And I took one look around at the people in there
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:57.940]   and I said to Linda, "I gotta go."
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:54:59.140]   She said, "What do you mean?
[00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:01.040]   "This is a thugs concert, I got comp tickets."
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.780]   I said, "I don't know, I can't stay.
[00:55:02.780 --> 00:55:04.020]   "I have to go back."
[00:55:04.020 --> 00:55:06.120]   So I went back to West 54th Street
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.320]   and listened to Mahler's Resurrection Symphony
[00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.960]   on the stereo earphones.
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:16.600]   The misanthrope, Emerson College.
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.860]   It's a good role for me as a guy
[00:55:17.860 --> 00:55:19.400]   who's always railing against society.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.140]   He's very misanthropic.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:23.460]   And he gets pissed off at his friend
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.440]   because his friend is always watering down everything,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:28.140]   calling everyone friends, so he feels he's indiscreet.
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:30.980]   And a play opens with him saying to his friend,
[00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:32.840]   he goes, "Friends, friends you say?
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:34.480]   "Well, cross me off your list.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.420]   "I've been your friend 'til now, as you well know.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.580]   "But after what I saw a moment ago,
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:39.620]   "I tell you flatly that our ways must part.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:42.060]   "I wish no place in a dishonest heart.
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:44.420]   "My God, you ought to die of self-disgust.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.420]   "Your conduct is inexcusable, sir,
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.920]   "and every man of honor will concur.
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.360]   "I see you must hug a man to death,
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.120]   "exclaim for joy until you're out of breath,
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:53.060]   "and supplement these loving demonstrations
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.060]   "with endless offers, vows, and protestations.
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:58.240]   "Then when I ask you, who was that?
[00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.400]   "I find that you can barely bring his name to mind.
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:01.680]   "Once the man's back has turned,
[00:56:01.680 --> 00:56:02.700]   "you cease to love him and speak
[00:56:02.700 --> 00:56:03.980]   "with absolute indifference of him.
[00:56:03.980 --> 00:56:05.740]   "By God, I say, it's base and scandalous
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:07.740]   "to falsify the heart's affections thus.
[00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.380]   "If I caught myself behaving in such a way,
[00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:11.480]   "I'd hang myself for shame without delay."
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:13.920]   And so it goes, brrr, it's just like a track.
[00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:15.820]   And if you don't get on the track at the beginning,
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:18.320]   all the words are slush, you keep falling off.
[00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:19.820]   It goes like dominoes, you see.
[00:56:19.820 --> 00:56:21.920]   So you have to do your warm-ups for an hour before.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.660]   You have to go, palica-tatica, palica-tatica, palica-tatica.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.060]   Or beeple, beeple, beeple, beeple,
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:27.200]   or a skunk sat on the stump.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:32.200]   Stump sat on the skunk, skunk sat on the stump, skunk, skunk,
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.260]   and they set a big bonfire underneath the stage
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:01.460]   and they opened the stage
[00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:03.660]   and they smoked the entire audience out.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:05.800]   (audience laughing)
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:07.200]   It was luckily, it was the last act.
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.880]   My friend, Sarah Braben, was sitting on an aisle seat.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.380]   She laughed so hard that she fell out of her seat
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.680]   and got below the smoke level, you see.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.540]   She was able to see the rest of the play.
[00:57:16.540 --> 00:57:19.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:23.060]   The Master Builder, my mentor, Paul John Austin,
[00:57:23.060 --> 00:57:24.460]   directed this in Boston.
[00:57:24.460 --> 00:57:26.820]   He also played the Master Builder and he had a beard
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:29.180]   and I had a beard, and he cast me and asked me
[00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.340]   if I would play the guy that, it was a small role,
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:34.340]   the guy that draws out the plans, but he said,
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.420]   "I don't think there's room for two beards
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:37.760]   "in the production of The Master Builder,
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.700]   "so would you shave?"
[00:57:38.700 --> 00:57:42.060]   And I said, "Sure, sure, sure."
[00:57:42.060 --> 00:57:45.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:57:45.780 --> 00:57:46.900]   The man who came to dinner,
[00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:49.200]   Back Bay Community Theater in Boston.
[00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.620]   The guy that played the lead was in the wings opening night.
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.180]   He was a psychiatrist in real life.
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:00.360]   In community theater, he was doing this play.
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.980]   And he fell on me opening night
[00:58:02.980 --> 00:58:06.440]   and gave me this huge French kiss, you know.
[00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:07.380]   I was a little shocked.
[00:58:07.380 --> 00:58:08.700]   I didn't know, maybe it was a tradition.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:10.020]   I hadn't been in theater that long.
[00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.020]   I guess it is, actually.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.020]   And anyway, I pulled away.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:18.820]   His tongue went right down to here now.
[00:58:18.820 --> 00:58:20.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:23.660]   I pulled away and said, "I thought you were a psychiatrist."
[00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:27.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:58:27.340 --> 00:58:30.520]   Way of the World, this is my first big lead.
[00:58:30.520 --> 00:58:32.860]   So I was very nervous.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:33.900]   It was a tough serene of theater.
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:35.220]   I was playing the role of Maribel.
[00:58:35.220 --> 00:58:36.960]   And I thought I was gonna die.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.300]   Whenever something good is about to,
[00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:39.420]   I anticipate something good,
[00:58:39.420 --> 00:58:42.340]   I also think I'm gonna die just before I get it, see.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:43.640]   And I always think it's gonna be,
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:45.780]   I'm gonna die from something that I love.
[00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:48.180]   And in this case, I thought I was gonna die from,
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:51.180]   the thing that I loved that summer, which was tuna fish.
[00:58:51.180 --> 00:58:54.100]   I thought I was gonna die from botulism poisoning.
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.040]   And so I was very nervous.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.780]   What I was doing was boiling my cans of tuna
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:00.900]   before I'd go on.
[00:59:00.900 --> 00:59:01.740]   (audience laughing)
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.580]   I'd still buy them, those were the good old days
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:05.820]   when you could get one for 39 cents a can.
[00:59:05.820 --> 00:59:08.180]   And I'd get a pot of boiling water and drop the can in,
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.300]   eat hot tuna before I'd go on.
[00:59:10.300 --> 00:59:12.420]   I think it's probably really good for my voice.
[00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.860]   And I was very influenced by John Gielgud's production
[00:59:16.860 --> 00:59:17.860]   of the Way of the World.
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.100]   And in fact, I'd listened to him do the record.
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.380]   I was very impressionable.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:23.860]   And I'd learn my lines that way by listening to the record.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:25.300]   And then I'd turn to the audience
[00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:26.780]   and I'd have to do this quatrain at the end
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:27.820]   and almost go blank.
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:29.000]   Whenever I would look at an audience,
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.420]   I would almost go blank.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:33.020]   And then I'd deliver the lines something like this.
[00:59:33.020 --> 00:59:39.020]   From hence let those be warned who mean to wed,
[00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:44.500]   lest mutual falsehood stay in the bridal band.
[00:59:44.500 --> 00:59:48.100]   For each deceiver to his cost may find
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:54.060]   that marriage frauds too oft are paid in kind.
[00:59:54.060 --> 00:59:57.700]   And the lights would go out.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:03.940]   Now the critic wrote a review at Tufts about this play
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.900]   and never mentioned my name once.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:10.180]   And I had the lead and it was a long review.
[01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:11.380]   It was very well done.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:18.020]   The Man, this was at Cafe Lena Gallery Theater.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.780]   I played a psychotic and I held this woman at knife point.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.300]   And she would try to get a message out
[01:00:24.300 --> 01:00:25.420]   to anyone that would come around.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.820]   Like say the grocery boy would come around.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:27.860]   She'd go and write in her checkbook,
[01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.260]   go, I'm gonna have to write you a check.
[01:00:29.260 --> 01:00:30.220]   She'd go like this.
[01:00:30.220 --> 01:00:32.640]   She'd write the check and then she'd say on the back of it,
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:34.780]   help, help being held by criminal psychopaths.
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:35.860]   You know, like that.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:37.900]   And I'd catch on.
[01:00:37.900 --> 01:00:39.700]   I'd come over and take it away and go,
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:46.340]   oh, Mrs. Gillis, you don't really wanna do this, do you?
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:48.620]   (audience laughing)
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:50.660]   And then I'd take this knife that had been shopping
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:52.600]   for two weeks by the apprentices
[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.900]   and go zip down the check, you see,
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:56.960]   until it fell apart leaf by leaf by leaf
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.000]   and then take the knife and run it down her spine
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.300]   and jab her in the base of the spine and she'd faint.
[01:01:01.300 --> 01:01:02.860]   That would be the end of act one.
[01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.840]   In act two, the director wanted me to strangle her dog
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.960]   in a closet, you see.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.420]   But we didn't have enough dogs to do it every night.
[01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.960]   So he said, why don't you just pinch it?
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:14.900]   You know, pinch the dog.
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.700]   Make it sound like it broke its neck.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.340]   I didn't do it, I wouldn't do it.
[01:01:19.340 --> 01:01:23.660]   Anyway, the dress rehearsal, we were there.
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.580]   I was very nervous, dress rehearsal.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:28.180]   I was on speed because my girlfriend,
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.340]   Alyssa Legg-Racon, was there
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:32.260]   and I was burning my candle at all ends,
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:34.300]   trying to keep up with everything.
[01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.300]   And so I was on these diet pills, you know?
[01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:38.420]   And I was very nervous because there were photographers
[01:01:38.420 --> 01:01:40.060]   up from New York City, friends of the director,
[01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:42.540]   saying this guy is really a good actor, you know?
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:43.360]   This guy's really good.
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:44.860]   I mean, so I was just about ready to take the knife
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.920]   and go ah, you know, like this, you know, for starters.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.980]   But I was trying to control myself
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.700]   and concentrate on what I was doing.
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:54.740]   I was really shaking and props handed me this,
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:58.820]   instead of a check, they handed me a piece of paper
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.940]   like this, they didn't have the checkbook.
[01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:02.620]   And they handed me the right knife.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:05.780]   But the check, the paper wasn't straight enough an edge
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.700]   to cut it, so I hacked a couple of times.
[01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:09.260]   I lost my depth perception.
[01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.840]   I took one hack and the end of my finger
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.380]   was hanging from a hinge, right?
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:14.700]   And I could see the white bone of my thumb.
[01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.060]   And I just was like this, you know?
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:17.380]   I had terrific distance on it.
[01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:18.780]   And they took me to the hospital.
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:20.200]   I said, "Do you think I'll lose my finger?"
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.940]   The doctor said, "I don't know, we'll see."
[01:02:21.940 --> 01:02:22.760]   He sewed it up.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:25.220]   I got back an hour and a half later on Darvons.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.540]   I came back and someone in the company,
[01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.260]   a guy in the company in an hour and a half
[01:02:29.260 --> 01:02:31.160]   had learned all of my lines.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:34.160]   (audience laughing)
[01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:37.460]   Endicott and the Red Cross,
[01:02:37.460 --> 01:02:39.880]   we did this at American Place Theater.
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:41.840]   Kenneth Haig played Endicott
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.740]   and he wouldn't dress with the rest of us.
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.340]   He demanded a private dressing room.
[01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:48.660]   He very much did the star trip.
[01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:50.860]   He gave him an office upstairs.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.740]   And Robert Lowell's play,
[01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.900]   and it was done in St. Clement's Church
[01:02:54.900 --> 01:02:57.020]   and Joan Baez decided she wanted to get married
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:59.700]   to David Harris during our rehearsal.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.420]   So we all sat in the audience
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:03.100]   and watched her get married on the set.
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.100]   It was a great set for us, the Maypole of Marymount.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.060]   And then Judy Collins and Mimi Farina sang.
[01:03:09.060 --> 01:03:13.020]   Much Ado About Nothing.
[01:03:13.020 --> 01:03:14.200]   I played Dogberry.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:16.300]   I like the play because of the malaprops.
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:19.780]   My favorite was Comparisons Are Odorous.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.500]   (audience laughing)
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.260]   Long Day's Journey Into Night,
[01:03:24.260 --> 01:03:26.600]   Portsmouth Theater, Theater by the Sea.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:27.920]   I was very into O'Neill.
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:29.340]   I was living in a Victorian house.
[01:03:29.340 --> 01:03:32.160]   I was drinking whiskey and I wouldn't turn up the heat
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.900]   so that I would suffer
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:36.220]   and the toilet would get frozen with ice.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:38.020]   I'd have to pee through the ice in the morning.
[01:03:38.020 --> 01:03:39.860]   The landlord said, "Look, if you turn up the heat,
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:40.940]   "I'll lower your rent."
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.160]   You know, I still didn't do it.
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:43.740]   (audience laughing)
[01:03:43.740 --> 01:03:45.620]   The pipes were freezing, you know?
[01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:49.220]   And so I would get drunk and I would read O'Neill's biography
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:51.100]   and then I'd go down and play the role of Edmund
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:54.820]   in the theater at Five Degrees Below Zero,
[01:03:54.820 --> 01:03:58.060]   four-hour play for seven people on a Sunday night
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:00.460]   and in a warehouse in Portsmouth.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:01.780]   And my brother came to see me.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:03.780]   He had been in Chile for three years.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.860]   And he sat in the front row and took notes.
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:07.320]   We hadn't seen each other for three years.
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.820]   The woman who was playing the mother at intermission
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:11.820]   said, "Who's that asshole in the front row taking notes?"
[01:04:11.820 --> 01:04:13.280]   I thought we'd been reviewed already.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.320]   And after the show, we went back to my place
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:17.240]   and bundled up and drank some whiskey
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:19.040]   and he gave me the notes.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:22.420]   (audience laughing)
[01:04:22.420 --> 01:04:25.440]   Babes in Arms, a deadly musical at Smith College.
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.440]   I was a resident actor at Smith College in 1966.
[01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.200]   And people would ask me what I was doing.
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.700]   I'd say, "Oh, I'm a resident actor at Smith."
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.880]   And they'd go, "Whoa, how's it going?"
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.160]   (audience laughing)
[01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.860]   So I never knew what I was supposed to be doing.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.240]   I always felt a little guilty
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.580]   and that I really had this golden opportunity
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   but I couldn't figure out what it was, you see.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:50.780]   (audience laughing)
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:53.960]   So to avoid confronting it, I would just sleep late,
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:54.800]   and real late.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.460]   I'd sleep till 11, 30, 12 o'clock
[01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:00.340]   and I'd get up and be directed by Smith women, girls,
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.000]   girl, women, you know,
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:04.240]   and in whatever they wanted to direct me in.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.880]   I was at their beck and call.
[01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.100]   And then I actually fell in love with Mary Powers,
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:11.680]   who was a 16-year-old high school senior,
[01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.920]   daughter of the writer-in-residence there.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.840]   She was a virgin.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:17.720]   It was my first experience with a virgin.
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:20.120]   And her father told her if she ever had sexual intercourse
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.960]   out of marriage, she would go to hell.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.200]   And I have to give Mary credit
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.000]   because she really believed in hell.
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:29.920]   Write me a murder.
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:34.700]   'Tis pity she's a whore.
[01:05:35.680 --> 01:05:37.680]   Incest play, John Ford.
[01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.360]   Brother fuck's sister feels guilty, cuts out her heart.
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.020]   (audience laughing)
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.640]   Then comes out on stage with her heart.
[01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:48.200]   It's the Cafe Lina Gallery Theater.
[01:05:48.200 --> 01:05:49.820]   It's September, it's very hot.
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:51.760]   The flies have laid eggs in this liver,
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.580]   which is being used as the heart.
[01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:54.700]   So there are maggots in it,
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:56.600]   and Joe Stigliano doesn't know it.
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:05:57.880]   And he comes out and he goes,
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.960]   "Look, it is her heart.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.780]   "It is her heart."
[01:06:02.780 --> 01:06:05.780]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:10.260]   A Practical Ritual to Exercise Frustration
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.280]   After Five Days of Rain by David Stockweather.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:16.980]   This was the first play that the Circle Rep did
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.900]   when they were at 84th Street and Broadway
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:21.500]   above Tom McCann's.
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:26.500]   Roots by Arnold Wesker.
[01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:33.560]   Heartbreak House, The Slag Heap, YMHA, Schenectady,
[01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:35.480]   August, No Air Conditioning.
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.000]   I'm playing Boss Mangan, waiting to make my entrance
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.180]   to Sarah Braveman from a fire escape.
[01:06:40.180 --> 01:06:43.640]   I've got padding and in my hair to make a gray cornstarch.
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:45.580]   We walk in, she pats me on the back,
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.720]   "How are you, boss?"
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:50.540]   And each time she hits me, great clouds of powder come off.
[01:06:50.540 --> 01:06:55.320]   Coriolanus, Emerson College,
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:57.160]   directed by Peter Douglas MacLean,
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.520]   who also was teaching there,
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.040]   who also played Coriolanus, the lead role.
[01:07:01.040 --> 01:07:03.000]   I thought I should have played Ophidius the next
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.080]   to the lead, but he cast a friend from outside the college.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.040]   I was furious, I thought he should have casted someone
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.840]   in the college, after all, we were paying to go there
[01:07:09.840 --> 01:07:11.720]   and I thought I could do the role just as well,
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.460]   but I didn't have the balls to tell him that.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:15.320]   So after I played my senator role,
[01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:18.060]   I'd go backstage and drink myself silly on brandy
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.880]   and come weaving out for the curtain call
[01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:22.840]   and almost fall off the edge of the curtain of the stage.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.740]   The Queer Fellow by Brendan Behan.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:31.740]   He had a company of Boston in the Bostonian Hotel in 1964.
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.160]   I was playing a small role, a cop,
[01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.060]   and took place in an Irish prison.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.660]   We all had Boston police outfits.
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.460]   For some reason, they allowed us to have them.
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.620]   In this whole house, everyone thought it was very weird
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.280]   to see Boston police in the corridors.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:45.740]   The people would be looking like this.
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.860]   One time, a guy had his wallet stolen and he ran up
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:49.100]   and said, "You gonna help me or what?"
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.300]   And we just winked at him and stood there.
[01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:56.300]   And anyway, Dusty Hoffman was in this production,
[01:07:56.460 --> 01:07:58.100]   now known as Dustin Hoffman.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:00.540]   Then he looked very funny and kind of homely
[01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:02.300]   and he was a very good character actor.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:04.440]   He was playing the hangman's assistant.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.380]   And everyone in the dressing room, when he wasn't in it,
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:08.360]   would say, "Dusty's never gonna make it in the theater.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.720]   "He upstages people too much.
[01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:10.760]   "He's too self-absorbed.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:11.760]   "He might make it in movies,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.100]   "but he won't make it in the theater."
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:14.580]   And then when he was in the dressing room,
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.500]   he was always saying about me, he was saying,
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:18.700]   "Gray, you're strange.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.840]   "Spaulding's strange.
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:23.100]   "Spaulding, you're strange.
[01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:25.140]   "Gray, you're strange."
[01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:27.620]   So I never knew why he thought that.
[01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:30.180]   But Ed Genest said to me, "You know, you better buckle down
[01:08:30.180 --> 01:08:31.920]   "because Dusty Hoffman's calling you strange
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.520]   "and it's a big grapevine, you see.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:35.740]   "It just gets right back in New York City
[01:08:35.740 --> 01:08:37.360]   "and then you're not gonna get work, you see,
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:38.860]   "because people will talk about you
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.740]   "and there's a hundred more just like you."
[01:08:40.740 --> 01:08:42.180]   You know, they said, "You're a dime a dozen.
[01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:43.140]   "Actors are a dime a dozen.
[01:08:43.140 --> 01:08:45.340]   "There's a hundred more just like you in New York City."
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.020]   Now, when he'd say this, I'd get afraid
[01:08:47.020 --> 01:08:49.020]   because I thought of a hundred more like me
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:52.620]   anywhere in the universe is enough to make me feel sick.
[01:08:52.620 --> 01:08:54.620]   You see, but I didn't know what it was I was doing.
[01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:56.800]   So I was trying to buckle down, right?
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.380]   So Dusty Hoffman would come on
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:09:01.420]   as the hangman's assistant with this big scarf
[01:09:01.420 --> 01:09:04.140]   wrapped around his neck and little squeeze box accordion.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.980]   And it was supposed to be all these sound effects
[01:09:05.980 --> 01:09:09.060]   of guys banging on their bars with cups
[01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:10.900]   to protest against this hanging.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.780]   And instead, this mistake they threw on the wrong,
[01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:15.180]   it was a beautiful Irish melody
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:17.060]   sung by this woman on the tape, you know?
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:17.940]   They put it on the wrong tape
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:20.740]   and Dusty pointed out the mistake by like an Irish setter.
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:23.760]   He pointed it by like going at the speaker, right?
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.760]   Where it's coming from.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.460]   It was very funny.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:28.600]   It was very funny and I couldn't hold back the laughter.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.020]   I felt like I was gonna faint
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:32.640]   because the more I tried to hold back the laughter on stage,
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.540]   the more faint I'd get until I had to leave the stage.
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:36.640]   And the director, David Wheeler,
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:39.060]   was in the audience that particular day.
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:40.140]   Now, I don't know why,
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:42.700]   but recently I've been thinking a lot about Dusty Hoffman,
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.380]   maybe because I go to the Grand Union
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.180]   and I make the mistake of reading People Magazine
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.140]   or Us Magazine.
[01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:48.420]   And when I'm standing in line,
[01:09:48.420 --> 01:09:51.140]   I'm beginning to try to figure out about how people my age,
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.540]   you know, like who has made it, you know,
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:56.480]   who is this famous and do I want to be famous after all?
[01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.540]   Was I just kidding myself?
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.780]   What's happening to my ideals?
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.660]   You know, I came into theater originally.
[01:10:00.660 --> 01:10:02.640]   I was completely idealistic about it, you know,
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.960]   and whenever I go home to Rhode Island,
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:05.360]   get my teeth fixed or done, you know,
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:06.700]   the dentist's assistant says,
[01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:07.960]   "Well, have you made it to Broadway?"
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:08.800]   "Yeah."
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:09.900]   I said, "No, I'm not really shooting for that."
[01:10:09.900 --> 01:10:11.120]   "Well, why'd you go to New York City?"
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:13.060]   She says, "Well, there's something else happening."
[01:10:13.060 --> 01:10:13.900]   "Well, what is this happening?"
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:14.740]   "Well, I don't know.
[01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:16.440]   "It was happening back in 1960, you see."
[01:10:16.440 --> 01:10:17.720]   And I'm standing in the line and I'm thinking,
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:19.740]   "Well, I opted for horizontal fame, you know.
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.480]   "That's what I took as hard."
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.320]   I'm spread out and I'm looking at People Magazine.
[01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.160]   I'm seeing a Henry Winkler.
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:26.620]   You say, "I went to school with Henry Winkler
[01:10:26.620 --> 01:10:27.460]   "at Emerson College.
[01:10:27.460 --> 01:10:30.240]   "He's making $50,000 each time he does a Happy Days show."
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.440]   And I say, "Well, he can't be happy doing that, can he?"
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.280]   Now, wait a minute.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.100]   Well, maybe he is.
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:34.940]   Now, what if he is?
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.020]   What if he is one of those lucky guys, you see,
[01:10:36.020 --> 01:10:38.840]   that is happy all making $50,000, you see?
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:40.420]   Now, why couldn't he send a little bit of it down here?
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:42.840]   Because we're $125,000 in debt, you see,
[01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:46.180]   and I'm making $125 unemployment, you see, a week.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.500]   And that's all I've been making
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.140]   and I'm gonna be 40 June 5th, you see?
[01:10:50.140 --> 01:10:50.980]   It's not gonna get any better.
[01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:51.800]   It's not gonna get any better.
[01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:53.420]   And I see that Henry's had a son and I'm thinking,
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:55.500]   I wonder maybe because I can't have a son
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.300]   because I'm not making $50,000.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:58.860]   I don't know how much it would take to have a son now.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.700]   Maybe that's the reason.
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:00.540]   No, that's not the real reason.
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:01.380]   Well, it'd be nice to have the money
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:02.760]   to find out if it was the real reason.
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.460]   And I'm standing there and looking at People Magazine
[01:11:04.460 --> 01:11:06.020]   and I say, "Dusty Hoffman.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.560]   "Oh, my God, he's gotten married after six days of divorce."
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.780]   Now, I had a pretty good idea of where his houses were,
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.580]   you know, and I thought I knew he had a house
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.180]   on the Upper West Side, probably a townhouse.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.500]   I had a good idea of it in my mind and I knew he had a house in Hollywood and I had an idea
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.380]   of what the pool looked like.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:20.180]   You see, I thought it was a kidney-shaped pool.
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:22.540]   But I saw that he got married in Connecticut, you know,
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.300]   and so I thought, "Oh, Connecticut, my God,
[01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.820]   "maybe it's one of those clapboard houses that's 200 years old.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.140]   "That's the kind that I would really like."
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:30.820]   And I suddenly felt covetous for it and I suddenly wanted one
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.540]   and I wanted one and I wanted one and I thought, "Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:34.380]   "Go back to your loft.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:35.380]   "You've got to get back to your loft."
[01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.460]   So I was going back to my loft to look for something.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:38.220]   I couldn't remember what it was.
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:39.700]   It was a book, a book of something.
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:44.500]   I don't know what it was, it was a book and I got into the loft and I couldn't think straight.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.660]   I couldn't remember what I came to my loft to get because this movie began in my head of Dusty Hoffman.
[01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:52.420]   It was a colored movie, you see, a color movie of him coming in from his kidney-shaped pool
[01:11:52.420 --> 01:11:56.460]   and he was all breathing in tan and he was breathing hot and he had on this box of bathing suit
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:00.820]   and he had this big fluffy white towel around his neck and he was going to open a $6 bottle
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:04.700]   of Perrier water and he was just about to cut into a lime and I could see no more.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.220]   I could see no more.
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:07.980]   I could see no more.
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:10.980]   (audience laughing)
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:13.220]   - The Seagull.
[01:12:13.220 --> 01:12:21.660]   Nine Advances, the second production, she wanted to do a very Stanislavskian naturalistic
[01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:24.700]   production of Seagull at the Alley Theater.
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:32.420]   She asked, she thought I would be perfect for the role of Treplev, the writer, young writer
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:36.140]   and she didn't think I'd been there long enough so she asked the guy that had been in the company
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:39.580]   longer to play the role but to use me as a study.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:47.500]   So he would follow me around Houston looking at me and she put me in the wings making silverware
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:53.060]   sounds for the naturalistic off-stage diner sounds, the dining sounds.
[01:12:53.060 --> 01:12:57.100]   So I'd be out there like Tinkle Tinkle with a, oh, oh, Konstantin Gorilovich, oh my goodness,
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.700]   pass the salt and the salt and the other.
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.420]   And then I'd help bring in the naturalistic trees.
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:08.260]   She added actual trees in big plastic molding and one coat, Madame Arcadinius cost $400.
[01:13:08.260 --> 01:13:16.340]   So that brings me full circle, the 47 plays.
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.900]   And before I stop, I'm just going to quickly show
[01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:21.940]   a few choice pictures from my actor's portfolio.
[01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:25.460]   Don't be upset if you can't see them
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.740]   because I'll leave them out on the table
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:28.260]   if you can't see the detail.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:33.140]   This is the first ad that I made when I came to New York
[01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.620]   to make some money.
[01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:37.500]   I'm a satyr and I'm leaning out behind a tree here.
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:40.500]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.300]   They thought I looked like a Reuben satyr.
[01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:46.620]   So they dressed me up and they went to a butcher shop
[01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:49.540]   and got actual deer hoofs and deer fur.
[01:13:49.540 --> 01:13:51.780]   It says under here, you never know what might happen
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:53.660]   but you can dress for it, you see.
[01:13:53.660 --> 01:13:55.780]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:55.780 --> 01:13:58.260]   And here the gals are all dressed up
[01:13:58.260 --> 01:13:59.740]   and waiting for this satyr.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:02.300]   Now they spent the whole day making me up
[01:14:02.300 --> 01:14:04.780]   and then put me bare chested with horns on my head
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:07.380]   and wreaths in my hair in the back of the station wagon
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:09.340]   to drive me to the Connecticut woods.
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:11.500]   They wouldn't put me in the front with a driver.
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:13.260]   (audience laughing)
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.100]   So up I went to the Connecticut woods.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.940]   I was winking a truck drivers all the way up
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:17.780]   from the back of the...
[01:14:17.780 --> 01:14:20.340]   (audience laughing)
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:21.460]   They were driving off the road.
[01:14:21.460 --> 01:14:22.900]   We got up there and they said,
[01:14:22.900 --> 01:14:24.460]   "Oh, I guess it's time to do the shoot."
[01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.420]   They were all eating boxed lunches and catalogs.
[01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.220]   They said, "We got to get up there to the woods
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:29.820]   "as the sun's gonna go down any minute."
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:31.940]   We went up 15 minutes later, we were finished.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:34.380]   Two weeks later, I got a check for $400.
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.060]   This picture here is of me trying to get angry
[01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:39.660]   with the soap opera actor up there
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:41.100]   at the Williamstown Summer Theater.
[01:14:41.100 --> 01:14:43.500]   You see this hand, you know what it is, I'm saying.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.500]   (audience laughing)
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:50.700]   This is my first publicity picture
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.340]   that I had taken in New York City.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:53.340]   I didn't know who to go to
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:55.580]   so I just went to any ad and backstage.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:58.180]   When I got there, the guy had a Civil War camera.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.540]   He threw this big canvas over his head
[01:15:00.540 --> 01:15:02.300]   and then took a wooden cup off the lens
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.100]   and went one, two for the exposure and put it back.
[01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.460]   (audience laughing)
[01:15:07.460 --> 01:15:09.500]   I guess this might call us my Christ period
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   at the Alley Theater.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:14.180]   They did it for publicity, it was no particular play.
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.220]   I don't know where the smoke came from.
[01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:17.820]   I guess they put it in there afterwards.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.500]   (audience laughing)
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.420]   This is 1969 publicity.
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:26.340]   (audience laughing)
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:31.980]   Playboy Magazine did a thing on Tom Paine
[01:15:31.980 --> 01:15:35.700]   because nudity was rising in New York City in the theater
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:37.380]   and they wanted to get it while it was hot
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.940]   and there we are in our see-through diaphanous robes.
[01:15:39.940 --> 01:15:41.540]   I'm all brandied up there.
[01:15:41.540 --> 01:15:44.540]   (audience laughing)
[01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:48.540]   This is the Great Crossing in Tom Paine
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:50.380]   where we were supposed to be crossing the Atlantic Ocean
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.860]   on this great rocking horse boat
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:54.380]   but we had more fun than the audience.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:57.020]   The audience always wanted to come up and ride on it.
[01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:01.940]   This is the set where Joan Baez got married
[01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.540]   and the cart in the Red Cross.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.980]   I'm playing the King of the May under the Maypole.
[01:16:05.980 --> 01:16:11.540]   And this last picture is of Bruce White
[01:16:11.540 --> 01:16:14.980]   having a vision of Christ over me in a Lotus position
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:17.780]   at Goddard College during Commune.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:20.580]   We were asked to come to Goddard College in 1970
[01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.820]   to be in residence to make Commune,
[01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.060]   to finish it there in September.
[01:16:25.060 --> 01:16:29.180]   It was quite a high time at Goddard because it was 1971
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.220]   and they were rolling high,
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:33.180]   although I hear they're collapsing now.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:34.020]   They haven't been funded.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.560]   They don't have much money.
[01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.620]   They're about to be closed down
[01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:38.500]   but then they were right on top of it.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:39.620]   They had a guy named Rusty
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:41.540]   who was teaching cosmic consciousness
[01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:43.220]   and he lived in the fields in the woods.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:46.220]   He just wore a loincloth in that freezing weather up there
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:48.900]   and there was a guy called Tony,
[01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.660]   the king of the bricklayers who had dropped out
[01:16:50.660 --> 01:16:53.100]   from bricklaying and came up there, would run around naked.
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.900]   And there was a guy, they do conceptual cruises
[01:16:56.900 --> 01:16:57.900]   to the South Seas.
[01:16:57.900 --> 01:16:59.380]   They'd never go on them but they'd...
[01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:01.340]   (audience laughing)
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.180]   They'd talk about if you were gonna go, what would you do?
[01:17:04.180 --> 01:17:08.060]   So we were in residence there and Richard Schechner said,
[01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:10.680]   "I sense the sexual vibes are so thick here."
[01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:11.520]   He was telling us,
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.460]   "I'm gonna gradually work into a nudity,
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:16.100]   "explore nudity in workshops."
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:18.500]   He was preparing us and telling us what his plans were.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.180]   And he went with this idea in mind.
[01:17:20.180 --> 01:17:23.940]   In the first day, four people arrived naked to the workshop.
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:25.580]   (audience laughing)
[01:17:25.580 --> 01:17:28.420]   So there was this Neo-Nietzschean group.
[01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:31.360]   This Neo-Nietzschean group who stood up.
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:32.460]   In line, in breakfast line,
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:33.820]   everyone would be just smoking grass,
[01:17:33.820 --> 01:17:36.080]   passing it down the breakfast line.
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:38.420]   And LSD and the punch and all the parties.
[01:17:38.420 --> 01:17:41.220]   It was this Neo-Nietzschean group that said,
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:44.040]   they stood up in front of the entire Goddard College
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.740]   and said, "Well, tonight we're having a group
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:49.000]   "called Chicken Shack, a rock group from London,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.560]   "who we want you to all come see.
[01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:53.260]   "It's a pro-life group as opposed to the performance group,
[01:17:53.260 --> 01:17:55.220]   "which is an anti-life group."
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:57.500]   So this set the performance group people off so much,
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:17:59.480]   Joan McIntosh raided the kitchen
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.980]   and stole Chicken Shack's roast beef.
[01:18:01.980 --> 01:18:04.420]   See, the Neo-Nietzschean group had a big roast beef dinner
[01:18:04.420 --> 01:18:05.940]   and there was a lot left over.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:08.780]   And Joan took it and everyone took symbolic bites from it.
[01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:10.220]   They kind of tore at it.
[01:18:10.220 --> 01:18:13.160]   And they take it from room to room, roll it onto the bed,
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.060]   say, "Someone's coming."
[01:18:14.060 --> 01:18:16.020]   They take another bite and they put the remains
[01:18:16.020 --> 01:18:17.260]   in Richard Checkner's fireplace.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:19.140]   It was just fat and string.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:22.380]   So what happened was, when the people came home,
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:24.220]   they found the roast beef missing
[01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.580]   and the Neo-Nietzschean started screaming,
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.220]   "We're gonna cut the breasts off your women
[01:18:28.220 --> 01:18:29.500]   "and the balls off your men."
[01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.060]   They were outside the door.
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:32.100]   At least they had it right.
[01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.740]   So they were outside the door.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.100]   They were outside the door.
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:37.940]   And I came down to speak with them
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:40.020]   because I hadn't eaten any of the roast beef.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:41.000]   I didn't feel guilty.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.340]   I'm the kind of guy that really just wants to sit down
[01:18:43.340 --> 01:18:45.060]   with one other person, a little candlelight,
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:46.580]   just a bottle of wine, eat it slowly
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:48.100]   if I'm gonna eat roast beef.
[01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.900]   So I couldn't concentrate on eating it.
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:51.980]   And so I talked with them.
[01:18:51.980 --> 01:18:56.780]   Now, what happened was that Richard called
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.120]   a kind of decameron situation
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:01.540]   in which we went into a barn for two days
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.580]   and we only left to eat and sleep.
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.860]   And we sat in a big circle, the whole company,
[01:19:05.860 --> 01:19:09.220]   and each person was allowed to tell their story
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:10.500]   or asked to tell their story
[01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.860]   about how they approached the roast beef,
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:15.340]   how much they ate, what they thought about
[01:19:15.340 --> 01:19:17.500]   when they were eating it, and most important,
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:21.220]   what this reminded them of in the past, this experience.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:24.220]   It was a kind of thing you could only do
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:28.120]   on a war economy and it was wonderful.
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:31.180]   Thank you for coming.
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:34.340]   (audience applauding)
[01:19:42.860 --> 01:19:43.700]   Thank you.
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:46.860]   (audience applauding)
[01:19:46.860 --> 01:19:50.020]   Thank you.
[01:19:50.020 --> 01:19:52.900]   I just wanted to make three quick
[01:19:52.900 --> 01:19:54.420]   advertisement-type announcements.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.540]   I think there are three.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:57.500]   One is that if you haven't seen Point Judith,
[01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.300]   that is playing at eight o'clock on Fridays and Saturdays.
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.900]   This is the set for that done by the Worcester Group
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:04.900]   and directed by Elizabeth LeCompte.
[01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.600]   And the other is that we're doing a reading series now
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:10.340]   on Tuesday nights called Rag, Readings at the Garage.
[01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:14.580]   And that will be posted in your alternative papers.
[01:20:14.580 --> 01:20:17.380]   And who will be reading each Tuesday?
[01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.540]   And that will be at eight.
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:20.740]   And then I will be performing two new solos
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.500]   at the kitchen on February 3rd and 4th,
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.220]   which will be total chance pieces.
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:27.000]   And one will be a chance piece
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:29.260]   and one will be chance audience participation piece.
[01:20:29.260 --> 01:20:31.120]   So that's on Tuesday and Wednesday
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.780]   on the 3rd and the 4th of the kitchen.
[01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:33.700]   Thank you again for coming.
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.660]   I'll leave the pictures out here if you wanna see them.
