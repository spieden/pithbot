[00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.200]   I woke from the following dream.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.680]   I had a little raspberry-colored mushroom phallus growing out of my forehead.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:57.560]   Nancy Campbell told me to try to cover it up with my hair.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.120]   I went to a cheese store to buy cheese.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.960]   I went to that store often because Dusty Hoffman worked there.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.840]   I asked Dusty for half pound of Fontina and then could not think of what I wanted next.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.520]   It wasn't that I was not interested in cheese, but I was more interested
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.840]   in why a famous movie star would be working in a cheese store.
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.400]   He asked me if I'd like to try some thin-sliced cheddar, and he showed me a very nice cheddar
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.440]   that was sliced in thin sheets, and I said, "That looks good. I'll take some."
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.800]   Just before leaving the store, I stopped and sat down. I think I was wearing sunglasses.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.080]   And I asked him why he wasn't acting anymore. Why was he working in a cheese store?
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.480]   He told me it was because his mother had lupus disease.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.840]   Then he said he wanted to show me something, and we went for a walk together.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.920]   He led me to the basement of a building and then disappeared, and I found that I was all alone
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.720]   going down to the basement, and I realized that I was entering a lupus colony.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.600]   All the people there were grossly crippled. Some only had the top halves of their bodies left,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.280]   which were hanging in harnesses. Others were missing fingers.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.280]   I was afraid I would catch this disease, even though Dusty told me it was inherited
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:20.360]   in the jeans. A woman passed by me and breathed in my ear. I got afraid. She was a kind of freak.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.440]   I looked down and saw that she had white feathers growing out of the palms of her hands.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:34.840]   So I woke a little anxious and found myself in Providence, Rhode Island, on my brother
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.680]   Channing's guest futon bed in his living room floor that he had rolled out for me.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.200]   And I was anxious not only about the dream, but that I knew I was
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.680]   returning to New York City, and I didn't have anything to bring back.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.960]   So to alleviate my anxiety, I thought, well, you know, if I counted sheep,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.840]   I might just fall asleep. I didn't want to fall asleep again. I wanted to get up.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:09.640]   So I decided to try counting beds, and I came up with 47 since March 1st of 1981.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.080]   And every time I come to visit my brother in Providence, I mean, we usually talk about
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.960]   music, Buddhism, the quickest way to enlightenment, you know, the method.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.400]   The quickest way that we were studying was I am one who you say it over and over again,
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.200]   no matter what you're doing. I am one who is doing this, and I'm one who is sitting here,
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.920]   and I am one who is reaching for this glass, and I am one who is picking up this cup, and I am one
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.360]   who is, and I am one who is, and I am one who is, and I am. So you get a kind of distance that goes
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.720]   beyond aesthetic distance into something else. But now my brother and I weren't talking about
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.440]   that anymore because he's become a landlord. He's bought his house. We were talking about property,
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.720]   and he and his wife have bought the house they live in. They live in the center,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.000]   and they have three stories. You know, they have the center one. They're renting out the top,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.120]   and a couple that's been there 20 years isn't speaking to them anymore because
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.160]   they've upped the rent, and there's the feud, and so that's going on.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:05.400]   I'm still involved with gurus to some extent. I mean, I do bring it back. I was in India for
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.360]   a while looking for, when I was in India, I got sexually obsessed. I have to admit it. I don't
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.720]   know. I think it had something. I knew there was sex going on in India. I had a strong sense of it
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:25.480]   because there were so many people, but I wouldn't see how it was manifested, because I was seeing it
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.240]   through American eyes, of course, and my American eyes, but at the same time, not being able to get
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.360]   a sense of it made me dwell on it more, you know, and so I got interested in tantric Buddhism and
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.600]   tantric sexuality, which, you know, are these classic tantric sexual poses that you get in,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.520]   and then you say, "I am one who is doing this in the middle of it," and so I was chasing around
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.240]   after tantric gurus, and I found out that the one famous living tantric guru was Gopi Krishna up in
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.640]   Srinagar, Kashmir, and I get up there, and I got an introduction, and it turned out that he was in
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:03.960]   Pennsylvania for the summer, and so he wasn't there, so I rushed down to a little Indian town
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.120]   called Pune. It's because I thought it was a sexy name, as the town goes, and that old reprobate,
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.720]   Sri Bhagwan Rajneesh, had moved there from Bombay because he'd got hustled out of there for his
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.280]   orgies and moved up to this little hill station, Pune, and some of you may have read about him in
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.200]   the Soho News. He's moved now from Pune to Oregon, where he has a small ashram about the
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.920]   size of the state of Rhode Island, and he's now operating it up there, but then he was noted for
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.960]   his sexual orgies in India. In fact, the Indian middle class was warning me often. They said,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.880]   "Oh, I wouldn't even look inside the gates up there," you know, so I thought that was the right
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:45.880]   place to go to find out because, no, I'd heard this, and I read it in Soho News after I came
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:52.520]   back, that he said that the problem was that all of us, many of us Westerners, are hung up on
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:58.280]   sexuality, and therefore we have to get a lot of it and get it out the way, out the way, so we can
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:07.400]   go on to bigger and better things, whatever that may be, and I wanted to know, and they said that
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.640]   what it is is they have these encounter workshops where you go in, and they turn off the lights,
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.920]   and before they turn off the lights, say, "We're going to turn off the lights now. You just go to
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.360]   town. You do things you've never done before. They may be freaky, but go ahead because we'll get rid
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.520]   of this, and we'll be able to go on to bigger and better things." Now, I knew something about what
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:30.200]   he was talking about because in 1957 in Barrington, Rhode Island, I had what I considered an abnormal
[00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:41.080]   desire for champagne, and I felt burdened by it. I felt taken over by it, and I wanted to alleviate
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.600]   it, so one summer afternoon, in the hot afternoon, I drank two bottles. It worked. Now, this was very
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.320]   hard to do with sex in Barrington, Rhode Island in 1957, so I thought, "Now, maybe I'll be able to do
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.080]   it in India," so I got to the ashram, and I went in, and now some of my friends said, some friends,
[00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.840]   acquaintances in New York said, "Okay, all right. All right, look. This guy, he's going to want you
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:09.560]   to wear orange. That's his trip. Just go along with him. Treat it like theater." All right, so I thought
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.160]   I knew how to do that because I had been involved in theater, and I got there and found it. I
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:20.200]   couldn't do it. I couldn't put on the orange. I was wearing a kind of beige pajamas. I was the
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:24.600]   only one in the ashram going around in beige. Now, if you put on the orange, and you don't have the
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.840]   mala, which is the wooden beads with the glossy black and white picture of him at the bottom
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.560]   around your neck, and you're wearing orange, that means you're about to take the mala, and in order
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:38.120]   to take the mala, you must apply for an audience after being there for two weeks, and then you must
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.920]   wash yourself in non-scented soaps. You can't wear any cut flowers or perfume or shaving lotion
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.240]   because the scents supposedly cause him to leave his body. He's gotten to the point now where he's
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:52.920]   very sensitive and leaves his body automatically, I mean, by accident. The slightest scent can jar
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:58.440]   him out of it. All of the pilgrims are worried he might not come back, so they were very cautious,
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:04.680]   and in order to see him, and there were about six people that could see him. It was a special
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.560]   audience. They had sniffers, which were his henchmen, two of them, like those little woodpeckers
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:13.800]   you used to put on a glass of water that would nod like this. They'd be at the gate as you walk
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:18.200]   through. They'd both gracefully lean forward and sniff you behind the ears and all over, and then
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.840]   you'd pass, you know, and go in. Now, we were told not to get too close to him because this could
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:28.040]   also make him leave his body, and we were to kneel right, you know, at his feet and tell him whatever
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:31.880]   it was we came for, sort of like going to the Wizard of Oz. It's that kind of feeling. I've
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:38.280]   never done that before. Some people came and knelt, and they got their holy name given. He
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.360]   puts a mala around their neck and shines a little penlight in their eye and tells them the holy name.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.760]   Now, obviously, I was not going to take the mala because I wasn't orange, so I came and I knelt,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.920]   and I said, "I'm an actor from New York City, and I want to know what I should do here. What
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.560]   your advice is." I didn't want to just say, "Where are the orgies?" You know, I think that probably
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.520]   would have been the most honest thing to do, but I was intimidated by the fact that it was religious,
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.880]   you know, and I thought, "Well, probably the most honest thing to do would be to fly straight back
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.000]   to New York and go to Plato's retreat. If you find God there, it would be a true surprise."
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.640]   And so, no, I knelt, and I said, "I'm an actor from New York City. What should I do?"
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:18.840]   And he said, "Well, we have many actors from New York City, and this I didn't want to hear. The
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.720]   Diamond Dozen Theory. It's one thing to hear that in New York, but there in India. It's a whole
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:31.720]   other thing." He said, "I would suggest that you go to one of the encounter groups, either the
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.960]   primal scream, the deprivation therapy, the encounter therapy." Now, I knew primal scream
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:40.200]   was going on because I heard them screaming. I assumed it wasn't torture. I saw people with
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:45.080]   buttons saying, "Don't speak to me. I'm in preparation for primal scream." But I thought,
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.600]   "If I was going to do the primal scream, I should do it back here or in California."
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:10:01.720]   Finally, what I decided to do was go to a zendo because there I didn't think I would have to deal
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:07.400]   with the guru because I was having trouble saying all the time, "I am one who is bowing down." So,
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:12.760]   I was never really giving myself over completely to the guru. So, I went to this zendo in upstate
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:18.440]   New York in the Harrier Beecher Stowe Hunting Lodge up in Little Lake in the Catskills. This
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.400]   was before they changed it into a big multi-billion dollar Japanese zendo that's up there now. They
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.360]   were just building a foundation. I arrived there for one of those very, very rigorous sessions where
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:33.240]   you're meditating for seven days without speaking. If I jumped into it, you get up at 4.30 in the
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:40.680]   morning. I was very nervous because I just think of stop speaking, not talking. It was good for me,
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.560]   but everything was going crazy inside me. I mean, you'd walk outside, you see a beautiful sunset,
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:48.920]   you couldn't talk about it. It just rushed in on you. So, you had to be very careful that you
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.200]   were in a protected environment because things are really rushing in. You couldn't talk about them.
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.000]   Lots of love. The woman who was cooking, I'm sure, loved to do what she was doing. My Sri Ramakrishna
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.760]   would never eat anything that wasn't cooked for him by a woman who loved him so he wouldn't pollute
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.720]   his body. Same thing up there. Whoever was cooking was cooking beautiful food, great. We had three
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.360]   meals a day and they were meditating the rest of the time. I can remember about the first day I was
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.760]   there. In the middle of dinner comes down this tray, a wooden tray, with what looks like little
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.400]   macaroon cookies on it. I think it's dessert coming early or some specialty item. Each day,
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.720]   I'd take it off with my chopstick. Yes, it never tasted any different than the rest of the food.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:29.480]   Then the third day, I looked up and I saw that people were putting little clumps of this on the
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:33.800]   tray with their chopsticks. I realized that for three days, I'd been eating the offering to Buddha,
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:41.160]   which caused two reactions. One was of guilt, which was one I was very familiar with,
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:47.000]   nothing new. The other was, "Wait a minute. I may be enlightened before anyone else.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.760]   I've been eating this offering." With that fortitude, I went up and I'd start meditating.
[00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.600]   I didn't have a colon. I was just counting my breath and looking at a white wall sitting
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.640]   cross-legged on a cushion. Again, about the third day in or the second day in,
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:08.360]   all I saw was black and white porn movies on the wall. A lot of fucking and sucking going on. It
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:18.920]   was very active. I realized these monks that make these mandalas, they sit in caves and project. This
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:23.480]   is a psychic projection on a wall. They stare long enough at the wall. This psychic pattern appears
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:29.880]   and it's like number paints. They painted in. They bang out another mandala. I hadn't reached that
[00:12:29.880 --> 00:12:33.240]   high point yet. I guess I was moving up. I'd reached the pornographic movie point. I guess
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.440]   a lot of them see those too, but they just don't paint them. They do and they're not around now.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:44.920]   I was doing the meditation and I was counting my breath. Often when I go to a place, I'll bring a
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:49.160]   book that I wouldn't possibly have a normal encounter with just to force myself into it.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:53.800]   This particular one was the I Ching. It was the only book I had a board in the truck in my van.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:13:00.200]   Each lunch hour, I'd go out and throw a hexagram on the I Ching and then pass out for a quick 45
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:04.200]   minute nap and then up for the afternoon meditation. Now this particular afternoon,
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.280]   the fourth day into the session, I threw the well. Then I went back to meditate. It was extremely
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:15.240]   quiet up there, very intensive meditation conditions. I got there and that afternoon,
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.800]   this incredible pile driver sound started like the building here in New York City when the
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.760]   pile drivers were started out. The Japanese master came in and interrupted meditation. He said,
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:29.960]   "I must apologize." He said, "The men have come from Pennsylvania to dig the well for the
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.200]   new Zendo, but what do they know of meditation? I told them not to come till next week, but they
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:37.960]   don't know we're in intensive meditation." So I thought, "Oh boy, oh goodness, I'm on to something."
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:43.640]   So the meditation was all that more intensive and I began to really meditate hard and then it
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:50.120]   happened. Everything I've read about or experienced on LSD and once you do that, you lose your
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:55.160]   innocence and you have to work backwards. So it wasn't really a surprise, but it was au naturale.
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:00.360]   Bing! I'm just an outline and there's no more spalding left, which was an enormous
[00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:07.000]   relief. And the whole room is floating through. I'm breathing with the room. The room's breathing.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:13.400]   It's just breath. It's just the barest of existence, like a feather. And then I leap on
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:18.360]   it like a tiger, eat it raw and it's gone. I don't know how long it was there, but I spent the rest
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:23.640]   of the session trying to get it back and watching porn movies on the wall. I don't know. We didn't
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.920]   talk about this anymore because my brother had bought a house and was into real estate. So we
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.440]   went out and walked about and looked at the different houses in Providence and said, "How
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.680]   much would that one cost?" And got a sense of that and barbed wire along the fences on Blackstone
[00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:41.880]   Boulevard. The first bed that I slept in was in Amsterdam at the Terminus. Now it's not one of
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.360]   your Terminus hotels. It's not one of your cozy Dutch hotels. It's a Greek revival. The only reason
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.960]   I requested to go back there is the last time I was in Amsterdam, I slept there and there were two
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   beds in my room. There was a small kitchen in the bathtub with hot water, which was a real
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.760]   luxury Amsterdam. So I was doing my own cooking. This time I arrived at the Terminus and they say,
[00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:02.920]   "It's March." They say they haven't got any big rooms anymore and they put me in a closet.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.760]   I mean, I assume it was a closet because there wasn't one in there.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:15.240]   It was a closet with a narrow bed and I just put my suitcase on the floor,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.280]   no place to do my yoga. And the window was this big and looked directly across at a wall.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:25.400]   There was no sky. Six inches away was a wall and it was raining the entire time.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:33.720]   And the only book I brought to read was Ulysses. So I was trapped. So I had to do something,
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:36.920]   you see? And I decided instead of doing a monologue, I would make the audience work
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.960]   a little bit for me. I would interview them. So my idea was to take this Dutch audience and
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.120]   have them write their name on a card if they would submit to this and then come up. And I'd ask them
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:50.200]   what happened to them on the way to the theater. And from there, lots of things could get rolling,
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   perhaps. But everyone said, "There's no way the Dutch are going to talk to you." The Dutch,
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:58.440]   the one thing the Dutch do not understand about Americans is how they can possibly talk so much
[00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:04.360]   about themselves. And yet I don't understand. The Dutch are always talking, but I don't understand.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.800]   They're extremely loquacious. They're always rolling the drum cigarettes and sipping the beer
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   in the outdoor cafe or the indoor cafe and they're talking, they're talking, I don't know what. They're
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:18.360]   probably talking about American missile bases in Europe or why Americans talk so much about
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.400]   themselves. That's probably what they're talking about. Now I told me the same thing in Belgium.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.680]   They said, "There's no way you can do this type of thing in Belgium." I was talking about myself in
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:31.080]   Belgium. I was doing sex and death to the age of 14. I was in a beer bar. Now in Belgium, they have
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:34.680]   mainly beer. I mean, they're famous for their beer. They have 600 different kinds of beer
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:39.960]   that they have there, plus they import beers and they have different glass for a lot of different
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.040]   kinds of beer. You have to serve it in a special glass. I'm in there drinking this excellent beer
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:47.640]   and this woman says, "Oh, you're an American, aren't you? Come over here. I lived in Los Angeles
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:51.560]   for a while. I'll buy you a drink. I knew you were an American. What are you doing in our country?"
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:56.120]   I said, "Well, I'm doing this thing, this story, this monologue." She said, "What's it called?"
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.920]   I said, "Sex and death to the age 14." "Oh," she said, "You've got it right. Already you know all
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.960]   about our country." I said, "What do you mean?" She said, "Sex and death. Sex and death." I said,
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:09.560]   "No, death." She said, "Oh," I thought you said, "Death. We have a saying here that if you have
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:17.800]   too much sex before you're 14, you go deaf." I thought you'd put it into the local mythology.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:24.520]   She said, "So the people in Amsterdam that I remember most is the man that talked the most
[00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:30.200]   and then this woman at the end that was the least outspoken or talked the least and the man that
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:35.960]   spoke the most was Eric the Knight. I think his name is loosely translated. He's a Dutch man from
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.240]   Amsterdam and he had gone to Los Angeles to start a magazine called For the People. Not People
[00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:47.480]   Magazine, but a people's magazine, a blank white page for the people called God, but the editor
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:52.920]   wouldn't let him call it God, so he had to change it to G. All right, so it was G and the first
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:59.080]   thing he got was a photograph of a man bathing up to his neck in his own ship. He'd collected it for
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:07.960]   weeks and he was saying, "Help, help. Is anyone else into this?" Okay, so they printed it and
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.680]   they got enough photographs to fill up the entire book of other people doing the same thing. I said,
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:16.680]   "You're kidding me. We talked 45 days." I said, "I've never been to Los Angeles so I'll have to
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:21.640]   believe you." Well, anyway, the Manson gang was so outraged by this that they threatened to kill him.
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:27.160]   They were actioning to this and he moved to Jamestown, Rhode Island where he tried to start
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.720]   his press there and he was arrested and it was a big trial in Rhode Island. Now, he is back in
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:38.680]   Holland doing art radio, you know, just capital A-R-T radio. He would get on the radio around 11
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.920]   o'clock and he'd direct everyone in Belgium and in Holland to go out who was listening with their
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:48.840]   flash cameras and drive around the landscape, the countryside, and at a certain time, at midnight,
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.480]   he would count to three. He said, "Get out of your car and flash your cameras. One, two, three,
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:58.920]   flash," and the entire Dutch landscape would light up blue in Belgium. So that's what he was into.
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:05.480]   Now, the woman that I remember, the woman that I remember was this classic, beautiful, gray-haired
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.320]   Dutch woman that could have stepped out of a Rembrandt, very Earth Mother type woman. She
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.920]   was with her sister, who was from Dutch radio and had a tape recorder because she was trying to tape
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.480]   some of these interviews with the audience. And I called on the woman and the sister with the tape
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.080]   recorder said, "I think it's a little late in the evening for an old woman to come up."
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:27.080]   And then the other sister said, "Well, I'd like to come up." I said, "Well, just the five minutes,
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:32.120]   come up." She sat down and she said, "I'd like to begin by telling everyone that all my life,
[00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:36.920]   my sister has told me what to do." She opens with that. Then we talked for a bit. She says,
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.960]   "I've always been interested in talking about myself. In fact, I would have liked to have gone
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:44.280]   into psychoanalysis, but the Dutch don't talk about themselves," you see, she said. I said,
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.720]   "Well, do you have any last things to say before you sit down?" And she said, "Yes."
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:53.000]   "To the women in the audience, don't feel so responsible," she said. "Most women think it's
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.960]   their fault when it rains at a picnic." And then she sat down.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:09.160]   So from there, we went on tour, Bob, Carol, and I to five cities in Amsterdam. It was grueling.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.840]   I mean, we assaulted them with all this American language and they were very impatient. And I
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.760]   remember in Rotterdam was the most difficult for me. It's the only time I've ever gone on
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.720]   to talk with Beers under my belt about five. There were eight people in the front row,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:26.040]   four left in the first 10 minutes. And then I could have taken the other four into the
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.120]   bar and talked. I think it would have been better. And so Bob and I are going with our
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:35.080]   hangovers across the country. I have a chauffeur driving this van. We're sitting in the back.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:40.200]   And every so often he'd pick up and refer to this flat, consistently flat Dutch landscape. And he
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:46.920]   would go, our driver was named Hans. He'd go, "Hans Spalding, one day all this will be ours."
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:55.800]   And that would be it. Then he collapsed back. And on to London and then Cardiff and Dublin
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:00.760]   and finally Paris, which is a beautiful city. Only everyone speaks French. It's the only
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:05.800]   problem is I see it. I don't speak any French at all. I was living on a houseboat there and
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:09.560]   pretty much just stayed on the houseboat. I was living on the houseboat right near the place
[00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:15.480]   de Concorde. And I was about to be 40 years old and I was forming there in Paris. And I was really
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:20.520]   trying to think about a vacation, trying to think about taking my first vacation and hoping that I
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:25.400]   could do it. And the only book I had to read was right beside my bed there. I just agreed with what
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:29.880]   I'm reading, what I'm trapped with and happened to be the 1981 May Playboy. It was an incredible
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.560]   interview with Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, who was working with the dead and dying. And she's
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.480]   suddenly seeing spirit manifestations down in Escondido, California. And everyone thinks she's
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:43.080]   gone mad, you see. And her husband of 20 years has left her. She's had $30,000 worth of workshops
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:47.320]   canceled, yet she says she is a strict scientist and she's got to see this thing through. She said
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.000]   all her life she thought she would work with the dead and dying up to a point and then she
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.920]   would retire and she would go out hiking and she would do her pottery and she would do her weaving.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:22:01.960]   And the spirit guides came and said, honey, it's just begun. You've got a whole other trip ahead
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.600]   of you here. And so she goes down with this sharecropper in Escondido. She says that all
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.400]   of us are born with spirit guides. The Bible says we are guardian angels. These spirit guides are
[00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:15.160]   three or four feet from us all the time, maybe four of them. And they are there and particularly
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.000]   working overtime now because there needs to be a lot of positive energy because we're heading
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.920]   toward a nuclear disaster and the spirit guides really have to intervene. The only reason we're
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:26.120]   not in touch with them is because we're moving around so much and we don't believe in them.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:31.640]   If we stay in one spot, they begin to manifest themselves. Now, what happens when we die is that
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.960]   if we haven't worked out our destiny, we go into the ethereal plane before we go to the Godhead,
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:40.440]   before we go directly to God. And there in the ethereal plane, we float around until and we have
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.880]   a choice. This is a very exciting thing because I never realized I ever had a choice in my life.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:48.280]   I thought at last, I'll have a choice in the ethereal realm. You have a choice to enter in,
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.280]   back in, to complete your destiny into the situation. Now in the case of Hitler,
[00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.720]   this is the case that they ask, of course, the interview is this, what about Hitler? Well,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:00.520]   Hitler goes into the ethereal realm and has that distance. So he's talking about I am one who did
[00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:05.400]   this, but he feels no guilt. He's looking back at the whole Holocaust in the ethereal realm and he's
[00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:10.600]   floating around there and he has to float around until he finds a totally loving, tender, nurturing
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:19.640]   family. And this may take three to 5,000 years, she says, to enter into and he's in and he becomes
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:23.320]   the greatest leader the world has ever had. Now, there's a faster spirit to come back from the
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.200]   ethereal realm. It was 43 years. The longest is 2 million and it's still floating around out there,
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.400]   she says. Now, the person that appears to her, the spirit is Anka and he's a Bedouin in a big
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:37.480]   seven-foot ten inches in a Bedouin outfit. And he says, your spirit that will appear to you,
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:41.960]   your private one is named Salem. Salem appears in front of her and she says, my God, if this thing
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:46.520]   touches me, I'll die. He vanishes. Then he comes back and does touch her, bathes her incredible
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:50.600]   love that she's never felt before, completely giving, touching her hair. In a spirit guide,
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:55.400]   American folk singer named Willie appears and begins to sing American folk songs. She gets
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.880]   extremely nostalgic and begins to think of her father's favorite American folk, favorite folks,
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:06.120]   favorite old song, I'll Be Loving You Always. And she gets nostalgic and he stops in the middle of
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:11.960]   this thing and starts singing, playing always. And she's believing more and more and she's saying
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:17.400]   that these spirit guides have to be cloned off the leader of this particular group.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.840]   He sits in the other room and they could clone with more positive energy that it takes to send
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.080]   a rocket to the moon. And you clone a spirit guide. At Christmas time, Santa Claus came,
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.080]   she said. They asked if it could be in different forms and she pulled on its beard. Also,
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:35.800]   a spirit guide named Mario appeared to her from the waist up only in Georgia and gave her an
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:41.320]   incredible 15 minute massage. When she got back to Escondido, he appeared again and she said,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.720]   just to test him, Mario, what happened in Georgia? And he said, in a gruff voice,
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.800]   she said, he said, don't you remember that incredible 15 minute massage?
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:58.040]   So by now, the interviewer is saying, listen, don't you think this is a psychotic break you're
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:03.480]   having? Because you've been working with the dead and dying so long, it's gotten to you?
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:09.560]   Not at all, she says. I've never been afraid of death or dying, which is amazing to hear that.
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:14.120]   You don't hear that often and believe it. I believed her for Westlander to say that. She
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:18.840]   said she never has been ever. And then the person says, well, you've been smoking here. You're
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:25.080]   chain smoking, camel cigarettes. Oh yes, I enjoy it, she says. I enjoy it. Lots of people enjoy it,
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.840]   the interviewer says. Yeah, but I won't die because you see, cancer comes from fear and
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:33.080]   I enjoy smoking cigarettes. I have no fear about it and I know they won't harm me. That's reminded
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.920]   me of my mother in a way, not that she was a smoker, she was a non-smoker. She was a Christian
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:41.880]   scientist, but she used to tell us about fear. She said that when our pipes froze in the bathroom
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.360]   in our house in Barrington, Rhode Island, from the wind blowing, cold wind blowing off Narragansett
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:51.000]   Bay, that this wind was stirred up by the fearful thinking of the communist Chinese in Red China.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:56.600]   And that she said that Mary Baker Eddy said there was a man that died on the operating table because
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:59.880]   he was so fearful that he started sweating, thought it was blood and died of fear.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:06.440]   So we were always afraid of being afraid. It was just going like this around and around. And I'm
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.840]   looking at this magazine, I'm thinking, God, I've got to take a vacation. I wished I had a spirit
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:17.240]   guide, you know, to tell me which place to go to. And I'm looking through it and I realize what a
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:22.360]   schizophrenic magazine it is the whole time. Because at first, you know, I'm just like that right on
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:26.440]   the article. I'm so excited. Then I realized what I'm reading and I look up and I see this is huge
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:31.480]   camel ad, you know, the guy is alone, a man, he's probably on a vacation, he's got the Jeep. And I
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:37.560]   turn the page and this is huge camel ad, you know, a windjammer, looks like all men on the stern.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.200]   I turn the page and this is camel ad, you see, and there's a guy here, a man alone, where the man
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:47.720]   belongs, expeditions, it remains Alagash wilderness. He's alone. I mean, I realize he's, or this is
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:54.200]   someone there with a camera, at least taking a picture. But that's always a consolation. And I'm
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:27:00.920]   thinking, I want to be alone. I want a vacation. I mean, I just, I've always wanted to be one of
[00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:06.360]   those people say, okay, Sally, pack it up, you know, pack up the bags. We're going down to Haiti
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:13.000]   for a long weekend. Just put on the credit card. What do you mean? Why not? You can pack it up.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.800]   I'm going to get the stuff together here. I'll just go take some of my work down.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:22.680]   Don't worry about anything. We'll be back. Plane's not going to crash.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:31.160]   If I was 40 years old, I was going to take a vacation. And I wasn't, I figured I needed a
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.520]   spirit guide, but instead of spirit guides, I was hearing voices that sound a little bit more like
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:40.840]   furious. And I wanted to go to Greece. And everyone was saying, yes, you must go. Everyone had an
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.120]   opinion about Greece. She said, if you've never been to Greece yet, and you have two weeks, go
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:53.640]   get out of this Paris. You can't speak the language. I like, I think the problem was my
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.440]   French teacher in boarding school, he, his mother died and he was very attached to her. And he just
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:02.040]   got real despondent. He didn't come in and a substitute came in. And then when he came in for
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.720]   the finals, he just put his head down on the desk for two hours and everyone passed the vocabulary
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.600]   book up and down the aisle. Well, I like, I like it when Scott would just, you know, he just,
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.200]   he wouldn't make an attempt. It was just nothing there for him. He'd take the menu and go,
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:24.840]   I think I'll have some of that boof, medium rare. I picture, I picture like a puff ball,
[00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:29.240]   a red puff ball coming in, you know, dripping, medium rare puff ball.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:37.560]   So the voices were coming to me. Leonard Pitt was there in Paris and he said,
[00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:40.920]   you've got to go. You've got to go. Look, if you've got two weeks, go look at this,
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.840]   the ruins. You have the book of the ruins, the book of the myths. I figured it was too much
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:48.520]   like homework. If I had to read those first, I didn't have the time. I wouldn't do it.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:52.920]   Then Aggie said, Oh, I went with my lover. We made love on the beach. We walked under the stars. It's
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:57.560]   beautiful. Stuart Sherman said that they had to tie someone to the mast. He got so upset about,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:05.480]   about sirens, said the light. Scott said he knew an ugly guy that got laid every night
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:10.520]   with a different woman in Greece. And Kate said the water was very clear, very clear.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:17.480]   It's very clear. Dale said she would never go without a lover because it would be such
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:22.760]   a sensuous experience that it would be a torture to be there alone. Liz said, what are you going
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:31.240]   to do? Go down there and dance on the rocks like Isadora? And meanwhile, I was calling my friend
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:35.960]   Randy in New York city long distance from the boat, from the houseboat. And I was saying, look,
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.480]   I was supposed to come and meet Randy because we were going down to Nashville to try to take
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:43.640]   a picture of Priscilla the monkey girl and Emmett the alligator man. I said, I'm going to be a
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.840]   little late for Nashville because I'm on this houseboat and I'm looking out at the Eiffel tower
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:54.600]   right near the Place de Concorde and I'm going down to Greece tomorrow. I hung up and I thought,
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:01.800]   who was that? So I get out of the boat and I start walking and I realize I have reverse seasickness.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.080]   I got my sea legs on the boat and the entire city of Paris is going like this. The Place de
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:11.400]   Concorde, I'm weaving through it like a drunk. I'm starting up the place, the opera, you know,
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:15.080]   to buy my tickets because that's where all the travel agencies are. And I start to see all these
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:20.920]   posters and I get completely taken in and I think, oh, each one takes my eye in. And I go, oh,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.360]   Switzerland. Oh yes, of course. Why not? Yes. I would go there. I'd be a good boy. I'd be a good
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:31.400]   boy. I'd go to bed early. I'd read Thomas Mann, get to bed real early, walk, walk, walk, hike,
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.160]   go to bed under an eiderdown, drink only two beers. And everyone said, no, you don't want to
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:39.560]   go to Switzerland. It's just a bunch of fascists there. I figured that would be good. You know,
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:44.520]   I think fascists can be very relaxing for two weeks at a time. They are the most
[00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:46.760]   relaxing people. As long as you know you're getting out.
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:54.120]   So I gave up on that because I figured it'd be too cold. And I started having
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:59.560]   flashes of Tazio and Alito. And I thought, Italy, of course. I'd take a train down there and muse.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:04.680]   I was afraid to fly. So I went to the Italian travel agency and they were out to lunch at
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:09.640]   three o'clock and no possibility. So I kept running back to the Air France to see if they
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:14.760]   still had the special for the two weeks to Athens, $285. And they punched it up on the board and said,
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:18.360]   do you want it now? Mr. Gray, I said, oh, no, no, I'll be right back. What time do you close?
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.600]   I'll be back. I go over to the Italians again and there's 50 people waiting outside the door
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.280]   to get in after lunch hour. They open the door and these people start tearing at the travel posters.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:35.320]   But that's indicative of Italy. I'll go to Greece. I went in and I took the $285. I put
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:40.160]   put it down they said for 360 you can be a free man I said nope nope and I need
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:45.400]   some some outlines there I need some borders I need some frames and I bought
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:49.000]   my frames and I headed out now I was really nervous because I didn't want to
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.640]   fly and I thought well I oh all right I'm going to Greece that's that if it
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.320]   worse comes to worse I'll walk I'll just walk over the hours walk walk walk walk
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:59.480]   walk walk walk walk walk walk walk I'll go buy some boots you know some hiking
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.320]   boots so I went down to San Jermaine and I went to this very fancy hiking shop
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:07.260]   you know and I started trying on the best beautiful boots for walking and I was
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:10.400]   having a real problem because I had lost contact with my body I was so afraid of
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.480]   flying that I couldn't feel my body anymore I couldn't tell whether my toe
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.520]   was touching the end of the boat and the only problem was that there was no one
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.260]   there that could speak any American you know they all spoke French and they're
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:33.880]   going all I needed was a good American authority shoe figure to go yes but I
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.040]   didn't want to risk it $60 so I bopped out with my puma joggers still falling
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:41.880]   apart I got on the plane I was very nervous everyone said don't whatever you
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:54.420]   do avoid Athens at all cost I didn't know how to do that but I met this guy
[00:32:54.420 --> 00:32:57.240]   on the plane that was an American expatriate that lived in Paris and he
[00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:01.660]   was going down to Greece because he knew a lot of people down there and he said
[00:33:01.660 --> 00:33:05.060]   look no problem I'll take care of you just take take take take a room next to
[00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.920]   mine go up see the ruins we'll have dinner then I'll show you where the
[00:33:08.920 --> 00:33:13.580]   subway is to the ferries and you can choose your island take a ferry it's all
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:18.900]   set oh great okay so I went up to checked into the hotel room right next
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:23.560]   to his I went up to see the ruins same problem with the Grand Canyon too many
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:29.320]   postcards too early in life just look like a collapsing wedding cake I just
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:33.880]   couldn't quite see it and I came down we we started we had a few drinks together
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:39.760]   and he started saying you know it's really by then I knew he was gay I knew
[00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:43.500]   he's a homosexual and he said it's really to your advantage to be gay when
[00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.860]   you're when you're traveling a lot like me I mean you just you make a lot more
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:53.800]   contacts and sex is a much more fluid thing and it's just more available and I
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:58.700]   said oh really and he said yeah and so we had dinner and we want went out and
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.320]   what I wanted to see some of the cruising areas because it's relatively
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.700]   homosexual city I mean the police raid the bars every so often and all they
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:10.720]   want to know is what part you take in an act of a passive in the relationship you
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:14.500]   know they interrogate you to that degree but so we were looking into cruising
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.880]   areas and I thought well it doesn't look that much different than Christopher
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:24.060]   Street only it does have a big history behind it you know you get a sense of
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:35.220]   that and so we looked at it and we went back I was tired I said goodbye to him
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:40.700]   you know got into my room but I thought goodbye to him forever got into my room
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:46.280]   started getting undressed and it was suddenly warm you know I've been I've
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.620]   been in all this cold weather and suddenly it's warm down there so I
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:51.420]   thought maybe I'll take off all my clothes you know I usually I used to
[00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.700]   just get into bed with my underwear and I don't like to get over aroused by the
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:35:03.260]   sheets so well tonight I'll just oh well just hmm you know and I got naked and I
[00:35:03.260 --> 00:35:07.300]   was standing there oh and that's a cuz got that springtime feeling the base of
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:15.420]   my spine I could I couldn't sleep there's kind of like a full moon and I
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:22.580]   scan I think I thought I wonder why he didn't try to seduce me I couldn't let
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:31.260]   go of that idea and I thought well maybe I better go ask him why so I went and I
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:35.580]   knocked on the door he said who is it I said it's balding he said oh come in so
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:40.700]   I kind of I was dressed by the end I kind of ease my way in against the wall
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:46.660]   and I said we've got to do something he said what do you what do you mean do
[00:35:46.660 --> 00:35:51.220]   something and he said look just relax take off your clothes go take a shower
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:36:01.060]   we'll talk I went into shower I came out like I thought look this guy's clean I'm
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:03.860]   gonna be traveling in Greece he's probably right I should get initiated
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:09.820]   and and it's better than one of those steamy New York gay baths and then I
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:21.240]   figured who would ever know so I I walked over and he said well what do you like
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:31.180]   to do and I said oh I don't know what do you like to do he said well I like to
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:38.900]   get my cocks up that's oh I would never do that I wouldn't and next thing I knew
[00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:41.980]   I was in bed with him it just happened like I was on automatic pilot and I was
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:46.300]   real surprised to find that he his body was very warm and soft like a woman's
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:50.700]   his skin was very soft and it was nice to be in bed with someone after being
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:54.460]   alone and traveling around like that but I didn't stay with that was a little bit
[00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:58.580]   too much for me and I went right down on him and as I went down him I was going
[00:36:58.580 --> 00:37:06.320]   in my head I am a homosexual and really going at it until that broke like a
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:11.760]   bubble you know and and I felt like I was sucking on this hard piece of rubber
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:17.660]   mildly choking on it and just disconnected piece of rubber and some of
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.080]   you may know what I'm talking about he said take it easy is falling you don't
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:27.340]   have to do anything you don't want to ease down you know he picked up that I
[00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.180]   was getting disconnected and he said go to bed you know take it easy get some
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:42.600]   rest and whatever you do don't go to Mykonos so I am I got in bed I thought
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:49.420]   God what have I done and I lay in bed and these faces started coming up at me
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:38:03.000]   like on a Rolodex Ernest Hemingway what would Ernest think Henry Miller
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:17.940]   what would Henry think Sam Shepherd same thing Lou Reed Sartre my father what
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:25.300]   would the village boys say and then a joke put me to sleep and laughed I got
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:29.060]   my sense of humor back that I had heard going around Paris and I went over in my
[00:38:29.060 --> 00:38:33.860]   head it has a French accent but you'll have to imagine it the man says so I
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:39.980]   sell six loops across the Atlantic Ocean do they call me Pierre the sailor no I
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:47.660]   helped build the Eiffel Tower do they call me Pierre the architect no I cook a
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:55.180]   meal for French meal for 500 people do they call me Pierre the chef no but suck
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:57.780]   one cup
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:14.700]   so I got out my Mykonos guidebook and read it and it was in the evening
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:19.980]   Mykonos offers either relaxation and quiet or an uninhibited enjoyment at
[00:39:19.980 --> 00:39:24.540]   the restaurants people dance eat and drink debate sing talk and fall in love
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:28.660]   just as they do anywhere else in the world I took my pen and underlined
[00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.900]   debate just just to be safe I knew there was something I could do that would be
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:39.780]   if I ran out of and I got on the boat in the morning headed for Mykonos I wanted
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:43.900]   an authentic Greek experience as well as a tourist experience and I was looking I
[00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.780]   think I was so afraid to be a tourist maybe even I was trying to become a
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.460]   homosexual first and I was looking all over the boat to see the tourists and
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.240]   the white they were in white dressed in white and this one person in the black
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.220]   dressed in black I thought might be a Greek I sought him out he was 26 years
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:02.220]   old he had a black t-shirt black pants the t-shirt said Chinese rocks on it
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:07.780]   turned out that he was the Kashmiri his name was Raja Prem r-a-j-a-p-r-e-m
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:12.700]   loosely transmitted translated means king of love love King he was from Kashmir
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:16.440]   educated in Dublin he was going down to teach English in Athens the job fell
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.060]   through so he's going out to Mykonos which he said was the queen of the
[00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:22.660]   islands each island I'd come to I'd want to get off at he said no no no where do
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.520]   you see Mykonos so we got to Mykonos indeed it was beautifully beautiful
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:29.300]   beautiful but still even in May overrun by tourists you know there's all by the
[00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:31.580]   Greek music could be playing out of every shop and these people would
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:35.360]   superate cameras on the booms you know with a with the sound sync out over them
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.200]   they were putting their wives against donkeys you see and getting all the
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.740]   natives out to pose with them it was kind of like a walking into a great B
[00:40:41.740 --> 00:40:44.980]   movie you know and but at the same time it felt very much at home because of
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.380]   having come from New York City and I thought well I'll just get to another
[00:40:47.380 --> 00:40:51.820]   authentic island soon I won't be staying in this horrible tourist trap so I Raja
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:55.660]   wanted to take a hotel with me I said no I wanted to do one on my own and it
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:58.500]   turns out that he would not go out at all with me in the Sun because he
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:02.460]   couldn't find oil of lei on the island he went completely wild only thing they
[00:41:02.460 --> 00:41:05.780]   had was greasy kids stuff he said you fry like a pig if you go out in the Sun
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.540]   so he retreated into his room and closed all the blinds because he was afraid of
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:12.700]   peeling all the time he said am I peeling am I flaking am I getting darker
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.420]   he was afraid of getting too dark because he had had some unfortunate
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:19.620]   experiences I assume in London in New York City with the fact that he looks
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:23.740]   too dark for you according to him so he didn't want to get too dark in the Sun
[00:41:23.740 --> 00:41:26.580]   until he got the oil of you late so I was getting afraid that I was gonna have
[00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:29.740]   a nervous breakdown after that we didn't get a little a little ritual going so I
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.260]   got a seven-part ritual going which I would do in the course of a day I'd wake
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.300]   up in the morning early and I would lie there rigid thinking of all the islands
[00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:41.060]   I should have gone to instead of making us and I go down them in my head I go
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.440]   Tino's religious I should go there right everyone's carrying crosses
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:48.340]   Sierras authentic but nothing's really happening Nexos it's a green olive trees
[00:41:48.340 --> 00:41:52.580]   could have an authentic experience there EOS Rogers said completely overrun with
[00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.300]   honey-thighed hippies the Greeks don't come out of the house anymore I thought
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.980]   oh how awful you know I wouldn't want that oh no I'm not a hippie I'm not that
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:03.700]   and then I couldn't picture myself there Santorini or I could picture that I
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.940]   would be walking over Santorini walk walk walk walk walk walk going all of
[00:42:06.940 --> 00:42:10.520]   these volcanic rocks until I just got down to kind of like a skeleton you know
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:15.740]   a really pure down to the pure bone pure bone with a suntan you know and then I
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:19.180]   thought Crete oh I could go to Crete Oh God I'd learn how to be alone there and
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:23.740]   love it I just work and sleep on the beach and just be happy to be alone and
[00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:29.300]   then then I go down to the dock number two and I would ask everyone that were
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:32.940]   getting on the boats what islands they were going to and why now I would check
[00:42:32.940 --> 00:42:35.940]   out of my hotel I was only traveling right I just had a sleeping bag my head
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.580]   was completely full but the all my arms were empty and I would check out of my
[00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:42.460]   hotel and say what islands you're going to I could never make out my mind I'd
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:47.140]   wave goodbye to them and feel this great sense of loss weep a little and go for a
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:51.900]   walk that was number three and after a few days of walking I discovered the
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:54.820]   slaughterhouse outside of the town and that's where I go every day it was this
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:57.860]   junky little house it looked like the other houses but it didn't have the
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:01.340]   white stucco on it and this guy one day was pulling this cow toward the door and
[00:43:01.340 --> 00:43:04.300]   I've never seen a cow resist so much of my life I'm thinking what the hell's
[00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.360]   going on here that cows resisting a lot he's dragging across the sand the guy
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.540]   pulls the cow around didn't doesn't even bop it over the head just takes a huge
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:17.580]   knife and slits its throat like that the cow is so surprised that it surprised
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:21.500]   the only word it's not to breathe through this great flapping opening like
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:24.340]   this you know as it goes down on his knees and pretty soon the whole thing
[00:43:24.340 --> 00:43:27.860]   his skin and hanging up in the blood is pouring out the back onto the beach into
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:32.340]   a big red puddle it's dries and feathers like red seaweed and I would go there
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:35.220]   feeling ashamed stand in the doorway he wouldn't say anything or pay any
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:37.820]   attention to me and watch them go through the slaughtering slaughtering
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:40.400]   slaughtering the more tourists would come the more things that was slaughtered
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.160]   and hung up and they I they weren't doing it just that week these men have
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:48.140]   been there all their lives and then I go back downtown and I would have the
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:53.700]   wonderful Greek yogurt with the fresh strawberries and then the number five I
[00:43:53.700 --> 00:43:57.620]   would walk to the beaches now there are two beaches paradise and super paradise
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:02.700]   walk walk walk walk walk you could take a bus if you wanted or a boat but I was
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:05.900]   walking I was walking it off I was feeling good on the walks you know
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:08.860]   between the town which was sheer chaos and the beach which was another kind of
[00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:15.320]   chaos because they were naked people there now the religious man in Greece
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:20.000]   the cardinal said air no nudity allowed except on paradise beach and super
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.500]   paradise I guess it was a tourist thing so you get there and I just wanted to
[00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:29.300]   sit down and read I had brought my Thomas Mann reader but I couldn't
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:35.420]   concentrate because the entire beach was lined with these frying naked bodies and
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:39.940]   I felt I had to at least confront all the women that threatened me and usually
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:46.020]   they threatened me because they were the women that were beautiful so I'd start
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.720]   at one end always hoping you know perhaps although probably resisting it
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.700]   more and more that I would romantically fall in love which required that usually
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:57.100]   that you get someone dressed and catch them at a certain angle it's very
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:02.700]   difficult in that bright Sun without any clothes just displayed like that plus
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:06.300]   I'm very shy and never know what to start talking about you know Justin you
[00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:10.420]   know one-to-one conversation like it's easy for me to talk to a whole bunch but
[00:45:10.420 --> 00:45:14.180]   one-to-one it's more difficult and also when you're bunching when you're hanging
[00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:17.940]   like that you just kind of walk down the beach right and you're naked so you just
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:24.360]   feel like very hanging and very so I started in the opening line would be
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.060]   because I know the people were island hopping so I thought would be a good
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:30.380]   line you know I wasn't really interested in the other islands I don't think but I
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:34.260]   was we thought it was a good way to begin so I'd say well what islands have
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:38.500]   you been hopping to and first woman said well I came down from Copenhagen well I
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:43.460]   didn't hear her so I said what islands that and it was over there that was the
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:47.700]   end I knew she didn't look up at me again and then I moved down to the
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:51.460]   middle of the beach and the next woman I started talking to was open and started
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:56.780]   talking with me but she I don't know she didn't take my offense I she was living
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:04.360]   she collected blood and urine samples in Vancouver and and then the next woman I
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.380]   came to on the beach she looked like a hippie and I thought oh boy oh wow I'm
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:17.740]   happy I'm happy she looks like my time so I knelt down and I said what island you
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:20.940]   come from she said EOS and I said oh yeah something of going there what's it
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:28.500]   like and she said it's different then I'd hike back to town walk walk walk
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:37.480]   walk walk walk walk and number six would be go wake up Roger on the schedule now
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:41.440]   Roger was locked into his room with all the blinds closed it was pitch dark he'd
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:45.340]   lying on his bed he called it his brown study he was in his brown study and he
[00:46:45.340 --> 00:46:48.040]   would lie there and he would say over and over I could have been a contender
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:51.640]   as he lay there looking in the ceiling and then he would do go to sleep again
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:55.300]   he goes falling is that you what time is it I said it's time for cocktails Roger
[00:46:55.300 --> 00:46:58.340]   get up you know we say listen am I peeling am I flaking do I look any
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.380]   darker than yesterday I said no no you haven't been on the center am I am I
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:04.120]   listen listen then he start to put on his ointments you know he'd have a few
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.420]   ointments no oilable a need shave and we get ready about an hour I'd wait for
[00:47:07.420 --> 00:47:11.500]   him and we take off for the Castro bar which is a beautiful gay sunset bar where
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:15.460]   you just drink ouzo and 7-up listen to classical music and watch the Sun go
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:19.580]   down very relaxing no pressure at all no threat just we had a little cabala there
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.980]   a bunch of people who were drinking with us there was Tanya they'd be there every
[00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:25.820]   night time and she was a 20 year old German woman that could be on the cover
[00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:28.860]   of Stern magazine you know very wholesome very beautiful and her
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:32.180]   boyfriend Herbertos so they said look like the English race car driver James
[00:47:32.180 --> 00:47:36.840]   Hunt this guy was so beautiful he was beautiful outside and inside I mean you
[00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.780]   couldn't make up a story about it I mean that's he can't talk about it it's like
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:43.600]   Billy Budd you know he was a cowboy in Oklahoma it's a German and he says he
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:47.080]   would give anything to you he was a beautiful man and then there was Colin
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.480]   Stone who had invented the garden gnome in and made 30 million dollars on it he
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.640]   did in London this guy Colin Stone he'd flown down there and is only a jet to
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:58.320]   celebrate because he just been let out of prison he had been put away he was
[00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:02.420]   bankrupt but some god gnome affair something blew up and he flown down there
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:05.600]   and he was taking a lot of LSD and going out to Delos a little island off
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.300]   Mykonos and chipping off little pieces of the ruin and bring him back in his
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:13.700]   jumpsuit then there was this guy Barry he was an IBM operator from Australia he
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:19.020]   saw himself as a kind of Oscar Wilde figure I don't know why I the only story
[00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:23.180]   that I remember of his that I really liked was that when he in Australia a
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:28.260]   very fans a garden gnome was stolen from a very wealthy home the odd of a wealthy
[00:48:28.260 --> 00:48:32.660]   home and taken around the world and they'd send postcards back say from the
[00:48:32.660 --> 00:48:37.360]   Fiji Islands saying having a lovely time in the Fiji sign the garden gnome this
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:41.000]   went on for three months until the garden gnome was put back on the lawn
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:44.360]   with little suitcases and little clothing that they admitted for the
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:56.320]   thing the only story that I wrote down was Tanya's and this was spoken to
[00:48:56.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   mala's Fifth Symphony in the background may I speak with you Tanya whispered in
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:06.780]   my ear I cannot give my heart to one man Herbertos loves me and has given his
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:11.800]   entire self he lives for me last night I rejected him and he broke down and cried
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.980]   he said he was going to kill himself I like falling in love I like the feeling
[00:49:16.980 --> 00:49:21.040]   of the passion I like lying on my bed at night and not being able to sleep or eat
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.700]   because I am thinking all the time of my lover's new lover I am thinking of his
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:30.320]   eyes may I tell you briefly of my father he is an architect and works very hard
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:35.000]   at 39 years old he had his first heart attack and now he expects another one
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.120]   any day and this one will be fatal I am his only daughter and he adores me
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:44.280]   people say his whole being lights up whenever he sees me he will do anything
[00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:48.880]   for me he is sure that the USSR will invade Germany soon he predicted that
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:52.720]   they would invade Afghanistan and they did the German economy is in a state of
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:56.280]   collapse and our Chancellor is about to resign because of this my father
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.080]   desperately wants me to leave Germany before it is too late but I can't I am a
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.080]   German my father gets very depressed about this he pleads with me he was
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:07.800]   going to help with the building of a collective bomb shelter like the ones
[00:50:07.800 --> 00:50:11.360]   the Swiss have and they have so many of these shelters you know but when he
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.240]   found out that it was forbidden to bring dogs into these shelters he said what's
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.620]   the use
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:23.020]   everyone at the table told me the reason that I wasn't fitting in on the island
[00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:25.920]   was I was wearing dungarees and a t-shirt and I had to get the white pants
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:30.760]   a wine shirt and hat so this was the last night there and they got me to go
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:37.000]   to one of those shops and loosen up with my cash and I got them all I got the hat
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:51:02.840]   still and I put it on get your eyes full yeah all right I felt great
[00:51:02.840 --> 00:51:06.080]   I would just felt like pants a shirt and a hat moving around the island with a
[00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:13.320]   straight spine and I went to bed early that night because I was gonna leave the
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.400]   next morning I was so excited I didn't sleep I woke up with the alarm clock on
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:20.600]   my chest it was like this and I got down to the boat and Roger came down to
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:24.200]   another tender I was three hours early Roger got up to see me off and he said
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.560]   spoiling spoiling you look like Bob Dylan that hat you could pick up any
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.080]   honey-thighed hippie I said I'm a busy man I've got to get back Roger I'm going
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.720]   and he said wait a minute wait I want to talk with him just going to the post

[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.800]   arrived he was happy the top had broken some of it was spilling out I said
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:47.960]   goodbye to Roger bye Roger never thought I'd see him again and bye to Mykonos and
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.640]   I look back and I thought my it was indeed a beautiful island at a distance
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:56.040]   and I was going out and I was starting to get very nervous I was just in my
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:58.980]   ocean briefs going for each time I would leave a different island the boats would
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.520]   go to island islanders were going back to Athens I would have this great sense
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:06.120]   of loss it was overwhelming to me and I didn't know what it was at first I
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.680]   thought I might have lost my sense of humor I got very nervous and then I
[00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:13.440]   thought then I thought that I realized that I had lost the experience on
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:20.520]   Mykonos I hadn't had one and this began to make me feel very dead and I began to
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.760]   groan and I thought I was gonna scream I had been doing some primal scream
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.040]   activity out by the slaughterhouse in the early morning I mean I was just kind
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:34.160]   of go out there on the rocks go by the time the tourists turned around they
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:39.960]   were all very mellow I just feel like this Wow what's going on down there the
[00:52:39.960 --> 00:52:46.880]   slaughterhouse so I was building up to that on the boat I didn't think anyone
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:49.720]   here because they were all American tourists they had stereo earphones on
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:55.100]   they were all going like this they had these stereo tape recorders and one of
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:59.540]   them took off the stereo earphones and came over to me and said aren't you
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:06.200]   spalding gray and I said my ego went
[00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:23.640]   yes why he said well I've seen all a lot of your shows I think you're wonderful
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:28.160]   I'm working in film now I'm doing film scripts and I have a lot of contacts
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:32.120]   with film and if you'd be interested I certainly put your name in I said oh
[00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:36.820]   goodness yes let me get your name and number and I wrote it down and in all
[00:53:36.820 --> 00:53:41.820]   the traveling I lost it I know his first name's Michael if anyone knows who I'm
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:49.580]   talking tell me I got back to Paris it was raining and went to Amsterdam when
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:53.800]   my flight was supposed to go oh on the boat Michael was with these
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:59.120]   anthropologists and they said why don't you come back with us they were staying
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.560]   in the poet James Merrill's house in Athens and I just got so excited
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.040]   suddenly Athens was a lot that had a lot of red light lighting up on it where
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.740]   James Merrill's house was I had a place to go and these anthropologists were
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:12.640]   working on the digging so I thought I was gonna have my authentic Greek
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:17.880]   experience so I got to the diggings the next day and the women from the seven
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:22.260]   sisters colleges seven we're all there in their Bermuda shorts sifting sifting
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:26.940]   sifting in his heat looking for little teeny little pieces and someone took me
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:30.220]   to the vaults where they have all the pieces and they handed me a 2,000 year
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:34.220]   old skull and they said this is a 2,000 year old skull and I hit it put it in my
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:41.780]   hand I said this is a 2,000 year old skull this is a 2,000 year old skull I put it
[00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:45.780]   back in the fall then I got on the plane and I was so nervous I thought the plane
[00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:50.220]   was gonna crash because it was the end of the vacation so I started saying
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:53.340]   little prayers I don't know who I guess they were like little promises
[00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:59.340]   conditions I kept saying if I get back in New York City all right I will I
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:10.740]   promise to make art out of this whole experience nothing no entertainment so I
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:13.900]   got to Amsterdam when my flight was leaving for New York and I stayed with
[00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:17.660]   these people that were really upset they said look we think the Chancellor of
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:20.140]   Germany a Trump someone tried to assassinate him I said you're kidding I
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:23.680]   just heard he was gonna retire because there was no more money and we turned on
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:27.020]   the TV and it turned out that Reagan had been shot and these Dutch people I was
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:31.660]   staying with they were growing people they started laughing and I got very
[00:55:31.660 --> 00:55:35.500]   defensive I thought it's one thing for me to laugh but when the Dutch start
[00:55:35.500 --> 00:55:40.940]   laughing and I got so depressed by it all I went up to bed early I was staying
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:45.020]   in this kid's room 11 year old kids room and he had a model of a KLM Royal Dutch
[00:55:45.020 --> 00:55:48.060]   airline taking off it was about this big I couldn't sleep all night I thought it
[00:55:48.060 --> 00:55:54.860]   was my plane taking off without me I kept waking up like this and I got back
[00:55:54.860 --> 00:55:57.700]   to New York and it's horrible I understand why people keep traveling my
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:00.420]   god it's just when you come down it's better to keep going around the world
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:03.100]   teaching a little English and I ran teach a little English in Bombay and so
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:10.380]   they go around around around till one day they die and so it's too long I come
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:13.640]   back I said it's better to stay in one spot or not to travel the rents have
[00:56:13.640 --> 00:56:17.820]   tripled it's hot everyone's complaining the streets are a mess that dirty so I
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.260]   head right off to my father's house in Rhode Island because he has a swimming
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:25.760]   pool it's hot I check in on him see my mother committed suicide shortly after
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.360]   she committed suicide a woman down the street her husband drank himself to
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:34.420]   death and so that woman and my father got together to try to make a better
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:38.580]   relationship out of all of this and get a house get rid of the old houses of
[00:56:38.580 --> 00:56:43.340]   pain and move into the perfect house and they got a very nice kind of motel house
[00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:49.300]   with fancy motel I mean nice all one-on-one level you drive in the
[00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:52.580]   driveway in an asphalt driveway past the tennis court on the right you go in
[00:56:52.580 --> 00:56:55.580]   this three car garage and push a button in the car one of the garage doors goes
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:58.340]   up with three of the garage doors go up there are three cars and three car
[00:56:58.340 --> 00:57:00.780]   garage you go around to the front door to press the doorbell there are 40
[00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:03.580]   different tunes on the doorbell they can change it every day that day it
[00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:06.300]   happened to be William tell overture changes according to the season the
[00:57:06.300 --> 00:57:09.900]   whole world is waiting for the sunrise jingle bell rock you go in on your left
[00:57:09.900 --> 00:57:13.140]   is a weather station and the barometers going like this and this in the wind and
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:16.820]   the velocity of the wind is being shown in the barometric metric pressure and
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:20.440]   the thermometers going up and down in this wall-to-wall carpeting the music is
[00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:23.780]   playing you go into his from visible white sound box between the beds the
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:27.340]   two twin beds and it makes static or it makes waves or it makes wind you can't
[00:57:27.340 --> 00:57:29.780]   sleep without the static that's his favorite white sound and we go down
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.740]   walking across and you go down to the basement and there's a freezer with
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.460]   every kind of meat frozen there frozen meats two freezers upstairs is rows and
[00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:41.540]   rows of bourbon just like in a retail liquor shop and there's a generator that
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:44.460]   goes on automatic when the lights go out so it's like a little citadel is a
[00:57:44.460 --> 00:57:47.660]   burglar alarm in the back is a heated pool up a big fence around it and astro
[00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:50.800]   turf and there's no problems there at all except for the caterpillars the
[00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:59.260]   squirrels and someone stole his flagpole twice with the flag on it and there's a
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:04.220]   pig farmer out back named Rocky and if the wind is wrong you smell the garbage
[00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:08.460]   when you're swimming in the pool now his name's Rocky my father's name is Rocky
[00:58:08.460 --> 00:58:13.860]   that's the problem too so to get the pig farm out of there they found out that
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:16.540]   you can't have pigs next to private property so they brought all the
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:20.780]   property between their property and pig farm big chunk then they take Rocky into
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:24.300]   court and say get those pigs out of there he says what do you mean and it's
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:29.500]   not your property we bought it this morning my friend
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:37.020]   everything's going fine except for the flies usually when we arrive it's
[00:58:37.020 --> 00:58:41.140]   cocktail hour five o'clock it goes till eight we turn on the TV you see watch
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:45.180]   zoom around five and then the six o'clock news in the six thirty news
[00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:48.420]   seven o'clock news and I usually can't tell whether it's the news that I'm
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:54.380]   talking to or my father and stepmother it gets all intermingled and then and so
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:59.780]   but this particular day we were eating outside the flies with a problem give
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.500]   the dog clothes the flies and my father's putting out a big bomb a poison
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:07.700]   bomb out by the table where we're going and my stepmother who collects antiques
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:10.940]   had a fly gun where you pull back this little metal flapper and pull the
[00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:18.820]   trigger and it goes if you can line it up right everything is going fine except
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:23.820]   people are dying now my father's friends are starting to die it's amazing when I
[00:59:23.820 --> 00:59:28.780]   hear about them because I don't know how people talk about cancer here in New
[00:59:28.780 --> 00:59:31.140]   York I don't have any friends with it right now but up there it's like the
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:36.040]   common cold in Rhode Island it's a well Tony and Lucy Gardner were over the
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:41.060]   other day and they both have cancer Lucy's doing pretty well she's got a wig
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:45.820]   she's taking the cobalt treatment well next time I go back well Tony's gone and
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:51.580]   well Lucy's going down to Florida without him and then my father found out
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:56.280]   that his boss had cancer he'd heard through the grapevine just that he had
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.160]   cancer and he decided to call him up to ask him how he was was true and he
[01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:08.540]   called him up and said Ted I hear you're not feeling up to stuff Ted slammed the
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:14.980]   phone down my father called yesterday and said well we had lunch and so and so
[01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:19.640]   is over and he had a heart attack that afternoon he was over for lunch and but
[01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:27.100]   he's 74 my father said and I'm gonna just be 70 in January so I thought my
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:32.160]   god what's it like to know that you have four years
[01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:52.340]   so I went off to Nashville I was going down with my friend to photograph so the
[01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:56.000]   monkey girl named at the alligator man this guy photographed every freak in the
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.800]   United States the pin human could pin cushion human pin cushion the two-faced
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.020]   man the dog-faced boy the seal boy but he had not photographed Priscilla or
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.500]   Emmett and he was determined to get them I'm not gonna tell you that story it's
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:17.180]   too long but I did meet down there three ex Princeton ministers who gave up the
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.180]   ministry and started a drug clinic down there in New Orleans and when the Reagan
[01:01:21.180 --> 01:01:24.800]   cutbacks came they had to go out on the road and they started a geek show to
[01:01:24.800 --> 01:01:28.780]   earn money just to open a new drug clinic where they was sucking on 15-foot
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:33.540]   pythons the head of 15-foot Python and they got enough money together and they
[01:01:33.540 --> 01:01:36.440]   changed their mind they weren't gonna open the drug clinic they are going down
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.840]   to Sarasota Florida and start feed a fish the ministry where they take bodies
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:48.560]   out beyond the 12-mile reef weight them down do a service look on the way back
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:53.860]   from Nashville I wanted to stop a Joppa Maryland it's a suburb of Baltimore
[01:01:53.860 --> 01:01:57.680]   because a friend of mine was a 39 year old grandfather and he sent me a card
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.700]   saying that he was a 39 year old grandfather I hadn't seen him in 20
[01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:06.400]   years and now I wanted to see him because he had disappeared he was a 39

[01:03:57.260 --> 01:04:04.820]   grandchild so I wanted to catch up with them no some years ago I decided I was
[01:04:04.820 --> 01:04:08.460]   gonna do my own work I just had this I was getting very frustrated with being
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.300]   in this windowless art house here for all this time you know and I kept
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.260]   thinking I know where I got the idea that there was something else happening
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.140]   outside or something something more important something more vital and I
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:22.460]   just would had to want to get on the road like Jack Kerouac so I was too
[01:04:22.460 --> 01:04:25.820]   afraid to do it so I thought I'd make a piece about it so I took Jack Kerouac's
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:30.060]   book on the road and I got a sex saxophone player Larry heck we used to
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:34.640]   get together and he but we jam you know well I would read Larry to play but
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:39.660]   Larry like many musicians he had took up first and I never smoke him maybe you
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.100]   know on a rear on the boom but I did it this time you know and I couldn't get
[01:04:44.100 --> 01:04:48.780]   any work done I just sat back and enjoyed him stop we can't do that I would
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:51.660]   just enjoy his music you know I said this isn't gonna work Larry I'm getting
[01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:55.700]   nowhere fast so but at this time that I was working on this thing I needed a
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:59.220]   Jack Kerouac album it's a collector's item he plays Steve Allen plays piano in
[01:04:59.220 --> 01:05:02.940]   the background you know they're drunk on Tokay and I had bought it when I was 15
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.820]   and I traded it with Roger Lund for Dizzy Gillespie album so I looked
[01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:09.300]   Rogers number up in the Joppa directory I called long distance I said hey
[01:05:09.300 --> 01:05:13.220]   remember that album I want to hear Jack Kerouac again can we trade back he says
[01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:18.560]   maybe three days three days go by here this workers voice upstairs go but Greg
[01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:28.020]   yeah I mean it's great album little ditties like this Jack will go I'd
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.600]   rather be thin than famous I don't want to be fat bend over and let out with
[01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:35.900]   large Grunto embarrass everyone in this video I'd rather be thin than famous but
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:43.940]   I'm fat paste that in your Broadway show and in walks Roger with the album he
[01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:48.140]   says is this it is this what you wanted I said yeah yeah thanks and he left he
[01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:51.900]   got on his motorcycle and drove back to Baltimore it's just a few words we
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:55.460]   exchanged a few words so I thought this deserved a visit so I called him from
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:59.180]   job I called him from Nashville I was down there with the freaks and I called
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:02.340]   him I said if you got a bed for me said yeah I think we can put you up so I
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:06.060]   arrived his wife Sally she hasn't changed a bit now they've had three
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:10.900]   children three children already right then Charlie wanted more children Roger
[01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:13.540]   didn't want any more so she started taking foster children and they've been
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.460]   29 foster children through that house in the past two years she would fall in
[01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:21.340]   love with the foster children and adopt them so they had two adopted adopted
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:24.420]   foster children and then a lot of little suckers you know about three or four of
[01:06:24.420 --> 01:06:27.900]   them in the whole room filled with cribs in this suburban house in Joppa they
[01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:30.780]   didn't know any of the neighbors I walk in the place is crawling with children
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.860]   Sally's sitting there she hasn't changed a bit except she's huge she's grown and
[01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:38.940]   she's wearing a big moo-moo that goes down to the floor and I got this image
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:44.580]   that the children just fly out from under like that she's just perpetually
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:47.620]   giving birth she's drinking a path through ribbon and she treats me as
[01:06:47.620 --> 01:06:52.440]   though I've just come in from next door but I've been living next door hi how
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:56.340]   you doing you know nothing special at all
[01:06:56.580 --> 01:07:01.020]   she says Rogers not here right now he's gone out to a bar you know he was
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:03.820]   waiting around for you but he didn't kind of get nervous there's this little
[01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:06.820]   towhead a little five-year-old boy running in and out little blonde frazzle
[01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:10.700]   blonde hair I don't notice anything he looks perfectly normal I sit down I get
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:16.580]   down at his level and I look at him and I can't believe it he looks like the
[01:07:16.580 --> 01:07:22.460]   90 year old five-year-old in the Enquirer the five-year-old that woke up
[01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:27.660]   age 90 years old one day he's got this face hanging down to here unbelievable
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:30.460]   he's bright little eyes behind it as though it's a total mask and not
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:35.740]   connected at all to his eyes and he pops out of the room and I go whoa Sally what
[01:07:35.740 --> 01:07:41.060]   was that and she says all Patrick oh we took him in they think he has muscular
[01:07:41.060 --> 01:07:44.340]   dystrophy we took him in for a small operation of a little bone being moved
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:49.940]   from his thigh to his ankle and they gave him either the wrong medicine or
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:53.900]   too much of the right medicine and it caused all the elasticity in his skin to
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.300]   go in his face his knees his ass his elbows and they're giving him plastic
[01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:04.420]   surgery now you know and so Roger comes in and says oh great yeah I'm sorry I
[01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:10.180]   wasn't around look he goes directly to his power corner which is this right
[01:08:10.180 --> 01:08:13.100]   angle the shelf where the shelves come together in the kitchen just like
[01:08:13.100 --> 01:08:17.240]   Muhammad Ali he goes into his power corner he gets his grounding get opens
[01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:20.900]   his beers and he begins to bullshit and talk and just feels great he says so you

[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:33.460]   circus barker he knew I was coming up from Nashville and also he was knew I
[01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:38.380]   was from New York City and everyone whenever I go anywhere outside of New
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:44.000]   York City people always feel they got to do something to blow my mind they don't
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.420]   know how to entertain me you know in any way I feel very inadequate particularly
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:52.740]   Philadelphia and so he's saying so you saw Patrick and well I wanted to bring
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.540]   him over when why when I came to meet you but so I thought talking with him
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:01.780]   and he says I said Roger how did you go through all the changes together you
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:06.260]   went you and Sally you know without separating it's incredible I mean he
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:14.260]   said what changes he's working down there at coca-cola see Sally's father

[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:49.860]   unit you know with the son-in-law and it's like this big clubhouse Sally
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:53.140]   never leaves the house she doesn't have a driver's license I said you kidding
[01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:56.100]   Sally why don't you ever get it she said I knew I'd have to drive to the
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:59.700]   supermarket all the time I never got it
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:06.940]   so look they only took one vacation in 20 years I said where'd you go they said
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:12.900]   LL beans in Maine up in Freeport Maine they said it was fabulous all the whole

[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:22.620]   Chinese food for breakfast in bed all the time Patrick is running in and out
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:26.420]   with a hairdryer blowing his hair blow dry you know like a beautiful a movie
[01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:31.100]   style like his stepbrother not noticing a thing he feels perfectly normal so I'm
[01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:35.080]   warning Roger all the time I'm drinking this Jack Daniels from from Nashville
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:38.780]   and Roger says you're putting that stuff away gray I don't believe it you know
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.100]   he's drinking his beers and I said you know you can't drink this stuff Roger
[01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:45.620]   is you're a thimblebelly so what do you mean I'm a thimblebelly you know I all
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:49.500]   right I told him I told stories I said I told the audience the thimblebelly story
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:53.700]   about you about how Roger and I we used to drink vodka because we heard the
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:56.540]   authorities didn't smell it on your breath so we'd have what's called
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:00.200]   luncheons on a hot summer day we'd get bombed we put the vodka in my father's
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:03.420]   freezer until my parents went away then under all the meat packages we take the
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:07.900]   meter and there would be viscous cold thick vodka and we drink it down this
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:11.500]   particular day we drank a lot we decided to go for a swim down the end of Chapin
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.500]   Road in the Barrington Harbor and Roger's a thimblebelly he couldn't hold
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:18.340]   his vodka he was falling down all these suburban lawns you know really just
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:21.820]   collapsing so one of the owners of the suburban lawns called the police when we
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:25.380]   got down to the river the police guy was waiting me I said okay boys get in
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:29.700]   Roger says why the cop says because you're drunk that's why and Roger goes
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:33.980]   you can't smell vodka
[01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:43.540]   we were arrested so Roger laughs you know but then he gets twisted and he's
[01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:47.780]   treating me a little bit like I from 60 minutes you know they're really not sure
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:51.220]   why an old friend would drop in after 20 years I know I have these green boots
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:54.300]   they're a little odd and nothing special you can buy them in New York you know at
[01:11:54.300 --> 01:11:59.420]   modals or something he goes hey gray where'd you get them green Viet Cong
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:04.100]   boots like this you know and he was getting more and more drunk he gets
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:07.980]   surly you know and I'd walk across the room I was a little drunk he'd go you
[01:12:07.980 --> 01:12:13.180]   just stepped on my toe oh come on Roger what are we gonna have who's afraid of
[01:12:13.180 --> 01:12:17.340]   Virginia Woolf thing here what's going on here and I was getting real nervous
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:22.020]   actually because I was having a pack of hypoglycemia it was 11 o'clock at night
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:25.980]   and there was no sign of any eating there was no dinner table there was no
[01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:31.540]   dining room table in this suburban house yet I saw a turkey so I finally got
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:34.980]   enough drinks and I knew Roger got it by then he got out the grass and he was
[01:12:34.980 --> 01:12:37.580]   trying to make me get so drunk and stoned that I would forget all the
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.620]   details of the visit so I finally said Sally I see you got a turkey there I'm
[01:12:42.620 --> 01:12:47.820]   really gum just collapsing over here and she said oh don't just we just pick you
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:50.540]   know just take what you want we run through and pick that's we don't know we
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:56.520]   don't have to sit down meals here so she put out the turkey right for me made a
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:00.220]   little setting and Rogers decides to eat he leaves his power corner he never
[01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:05.020]   should have he reels across hits the table knocks over a full bottle of wine
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:09.540]   collapses on the table inhales the entire turkey dinner and says I'm going
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:17.380]   to bed put a blanket on the floor for spud so I said to Sally what's happened
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:20.620]   what's going on you know is he pissed at me oh no no she says I think he's really
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:25.380]   upset about Patrick you know he was really sad you know 300 doctors have
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.580]   come to see him there's no case like this in the northeastern United States
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:31.900]   they go through the hospital in groups you know and he has to be in the
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:35.160]   hospital and he won't he gets tired of showing his face and his ass and his
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.980]   elbow so he just sticks out a foot he says that's all you're gonna see today
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.720]   and the foot hasn't got any stretch marks on it at all the doctors to see
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:46.700]   this foot sticking out from under the sheet so she says what's happening let's
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.900]   talk I could talk all night she said I haven't talked with any grown-ups in 20
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:55.340]   years so we started to talk she says what's new besides this business about
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:14:03.820]   telling stories and I said well you know I have started therapy go why she said
[01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:07.740]   why would you do a thing like that you didn't have an unhappy childhood did you
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:11.060]   I said well I don't know I don't think it has to do with that I mean lots of
[01:14:11.060 --> 01:14:18.300]   people in New York go to therapists I know I know people I said I really do
[01:14:18.300 --> 01:14:22.220]   they call it doing therapy there no and she said well why would you want to do a
[01:14:22.220 --> 01:14:25.620]   thing like that I said well you know it's nice at the end of the week you get
[01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:30.220]   this chance to kind of bring everything together with a witness and kind of
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:35.420]   reflect on it and reflect she says I haven't reflected in 20 years and I'm
[01:14:35.420 --> 01:14:40.100]   doing fine she said I don't see why you I just don't have the time she said I
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:43.380]   don't see why you don't get hypnotized and find out about reincarnation skip
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:48.100]   your parents go back to your past lives I said Sally every time I've heard about
[01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:51.420]   someone getting hypnotized and find out what reincarnation they were either a
[01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.780]   king or queen of Egypt you know there was never anyone carrying the stones up
[01:14:55.780 --> 01:15:00.260]   the pyramids who wants to find out about that and besides if there's a nuclear
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:05.620]   holocaust how the fuck you're gonna have an earth to reincarnate on she said you
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:15.820]   have a point she said you know I said when did Patrick you know first find out
[01:15:15.820 --> 01:15:20.900]   about this this is what he looked like oh she said it was a while after you get
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:25.140]   out of the hospital because he was too small to look at any mirrors and Roger
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:29.660]   had a mirror down on the floor one day he was looking at and Patrick came over
[01:15:29.660 --> 01:15:38.920]   his shoulder and looked in and went hey wait a minute I look like that King Roger
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:49.260]   goes what King that King who got shot you know get King Reagan he said I look

[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:58.700]   hangover after last night he said hangover who has time then I realized
[01:16:58.700 --> 01:17:03.980]   like this this cut I got from a spoon in the crease of my hands driving me nuts
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:10.420]   and a little swelling on my knee base of my spine problem I'm just feeling all

[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:40.320]   being poisoned and they want it directly from home so I said walk me to the car
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:44.200]   we go we get out to the car I said Roger how'd you make it through all these
[01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:49.300]   years he said I don't think about it I don't think about it and I astral
[01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:57.640]   project I said now you tell me just when I'm leaving I don't mean he said just

[01:19:47.680 --> 01:19:51.120]   the dark place completely out of sight at the end of the show I asked the
[01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:56.200]   audience if there's any questions and they say yes where are these people real
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.440]   that you meet I mean where do you meet them or are they made up I said no no

[01:20:03.480 --> 01:20:11.520]   perm instead of Roger prim and I spell it RA GA BERM he was mortified he came
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:15.960]   down he sat at the desk and I sat over here and he proceeded to tell his
[01:20:15.960 --> 01:20:19.640]   version of Greece and how he saw me it was wonderful the audience thought it
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:23.960]   was all made up that he was a plant that we had written the whole thing he went
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:27.840]   out to the lager mill around the corner and lo and behold people saw him said he
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:31.240]   looked wonderful under the lights and he was approached by what he called a
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:36.400]   vacuous blonde now Racha and I realized that when I was staying in Greece that I
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:40.720]   had met a real Greek myth a living narcissist you know a narcissist because
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:44.160]   he would only exist to be seen he would be in his dark room and he would come
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:48.160]   out and we'd go to the different bars but he still hadn't graduated he was
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.720]   still just in first grade narcissism because he felt he had to respond to
[01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:55.240]   every man and woman that would look at him so with the vacuous blonde he would
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:57.600]   feel he'd have to go to bed with him he hasn't learned yet that the true
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:01.840]   narcissist just walked into a room and let's it drip off him or her like water
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:06.720]   off a duck's back but he couldn't do that in lager mail he got caught up with
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:10.320]   his vacuous blonde so he gets a call he calls me up and he says they won't
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.480]   believe it the vacuous plan call me and she wants to take me to a bowling alley
[01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:26.040]   I got into it I said a bowling alley you're kidding in New York City go so I
[01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:30.480]   expect that I'm not gonna see him back in bed I think oh goodness goodness
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.200]   goodness he's got a girlfriend that's good I'd come back this is about the
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.480]   fifth day and he's in bed and I said what happened you know awful it was

[01:21:46.340 --> 01:21:49.960]   example she sees a man coming down the street and she'll go to her friend Oh

[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:22.520]   the time's up he said maybe I should go to maybe we should go to Rio or maybe
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.800]   back to England he started making these calls we call dr. Norman Norman orange
[01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:29.860]   rice then he said to me am I peeling my flaking look look at me no no really is

[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:45.800]   and for the first time in my life I felt like this I heard this adult voice
[01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:55.280]   coming up I finally had a child and I was reluctant to give it up I said
[01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:59.760]   you've got to go we couldn't find a cab he got nervous he went he was off to the
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.400]   lab he was off to the Pickwick arms up in Lexington and 51st you can get a good
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:08.600]   room for $17 a single he gets caught in the turnstile of the automatic token
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.040]   thing his pressures his ribs he gets to the hotel it calls me says I've got to
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.520]   come back down I forgot my glue he's having separation anxiety I said buy
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:17.960]   some glue up there what do you need it for he said I have certain things I have
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:28.640]   to glue together so I said I thought the next day I would confront him on what it
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:33.520]   was he wanted here because I couldn't go on I kept telling him I was a busy man I
[01:23:33.520 --> 01:23:39.560]   he called me I said all right we'll meet for lunch at Eva's on 8th Street and we
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:44.160]   got in there and I said Roger what is it you're looking for what what is it you
[01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:49.400]   want he said an epiphany I go from city to city hoping for an epiphany so what
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:53.080]   is your idea of an epiphany said like in the Catholic Church when everything your
[01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:56.560]   whole life comes together and it's totally the puzzle fits together
[01:23:56.560 --> 01:24:01.320]   everything is meaningful you have no past or future you're just there and you
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:05.800]   understand I said don't have one here in Eva's I'm not gonna be the one to take
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:10.480]   you to Bellevue I said the Catholic Church exists for a reason so you can
[01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:17.320]   have epiphanies in a safe way it's a big support system so he said and I said
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.200]   furthermore I think you're going to the wrong doctor I don't think you should be
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:25.360]   going to a skin specialist he said look he said sporting something did happen
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.920]   didn't it I mean we had we had a good time didn't we I mean he said you know
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:33.000]   the lights being under the lights that was really the sexiest that was better
[01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:38.120]   than sex he said it was wonderful I think we should do a duo and no I said I
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:46.880]   have to get this sell-off business out of the way and he said well look he said
[01:24:46.880 --> 01:24:52.120]   well I don't know maybe I'm gonna go I said all right look I give me I was
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.800]   gonna give him a hug he didn't he wouldn't commit himself to going said
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.720]   maybe I'm going maybe enough so we left in a very weird way and I went back and
[01:24:59.720 --> 01:25:03.400]   I took the phone off the hook you know and tried to get some rest and I put it
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:06.440]   on at 6 o'clock and he called he said well I'm out here at the airport I'm off
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:09.360]   there's a beautiful blonde out here from Ireland who's gonna be on my flight
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:13.720]   she's looking at me now hi oh and he said that by the way I made a few phone
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:17.680]   calls to London on your phone I hope you don't mind he said in that I knew there
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:20.560]   was something weird because of just before he left he had a $10 bill I was
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:23.760]   sitting on the phone he went like this
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:35.480]   what the fuck was that I realized he was trying to pay for the call now he calls
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:39.920]   once a week from London to give me little reports like it's snowing in
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.580]   London he's going to see Colin Stone with the garden gnomes and he says the
[01:25:44.580 --> 01:25:51.480]   gnomes talk and the gnomes walk last week he called to say that you've read
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:56.560]   in Oscar Wilde's Reading Jail that one could have epiphanies from going to city
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.120]   to city that it was true you didn't have to stay in one spot and he was going
[01:26:00.120 --> 01:26:04.800]   down to Venice to try to have another one and this week he called and told me
[01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:15.800]   they had found sita macrogola with sebum which is the ultimate skin cream and I
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:39.560]   hung up the phone and I thought I find some normal people thank you for coming
