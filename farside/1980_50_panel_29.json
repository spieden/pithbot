  "description": "Two fish leap from the water towards a steep concrete slope, excitedly pointing at a small figure on the embankment. The figure, a human in bright clothing, appears vulnerable and sweating. From the perspective of these aquatic predators, the human is seen as potential prey, a 'worm' on land. This absurd role reversal inverts the typical dynamic between humans as fishermen and fish as their catch. The scene presents a surreal inversion of expectations, highlighting the arbitrary nature of perspective and vulnerability.",
