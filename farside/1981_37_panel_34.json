  "description": "A scarecrow, accompanied by a person wearing a tribal headdress, is shopping for masks in a store. The scarecrow holds up a black eye mask, questioning the salesperson about the absence of punched holes. This scene presents an absurd situation where an inanimate figure concerned with details relevant only to living beings seeks to purchase a disguise, highlighting the surreal nature of the characters' actions. The store displays a variety of unusual masks on shelves, including monster and clown faces as well as a Groucho Marx nose and glasses, adding to the strange environment. The dialogue points out the irony of a straw figure needing eyeholes in a mask.",
