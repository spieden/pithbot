  "description": "Two birds are building a nest in a tree. One bird, perched in the nest, holds a twig in its beak, while another bird flies towards it. The flying bird carries a struggling stick figure person, gripping its head and foot as if it were collecting nesting material. This surreal scene presents a disturbing inversion of natural behavior, treating a human as a mere object for construction.",
