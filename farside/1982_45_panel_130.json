  "description": "A woman, fully dressed and holding a coat, expresses frustration with a man who is reading a newspaper in an armchair. The man is not yet ready to leave, and the source of his unreadiness is depicted as a surreal situation: he is literally not yet fully drawn, lacking a face. This highlights the absurdity of his lack of preparation through a meta-commentary on the nature of creation and readiness.",
