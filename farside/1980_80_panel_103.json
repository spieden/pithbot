  "description": "In a bullfighting arena, a small, donkey-like bull has tossed a matador high into the air. Oversized spectators wearing sombreros and floral patterns are watching, with one excitedly waving a sombrero. The scene subverts the expectation of a powerful bull and a dominant matador. The crowd's cheer of \"Ol\u00e9!\" is directed at the matador's airborne predicament. This presents an absurd reversal of the traditional bullfight narrative.",
