  "description": "Two explorers are rapidly melting into puddles on the floor of an ancient crypt filled with sarcophagi. One figure holds a giant burning matchstick, illuminating strange symbols inscribed on a tall, narrow object shaped like a bird's head. As they melt, one remarks on the presence of an ancient curse affecting those who defile the crypt. This scene presents a surreal and darkly humorous depiction of the immediate and literal consequences of disturbing ancient sites.",
  "caption": "\"Ha! Check this out, Andrews. ... Seems there's some kind of ancient curse on those who defile this crypt.\"",
