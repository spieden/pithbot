  "description": "An elderly couple stands defensively on a staircase, one holding a baseball bat, the other a flashlight aimed down. Illuminated by the beam is a rhinoceros, unusually wearing a long coat, holding a glass and a slice of cake. This surreal domestic encounter places a wild animal in a casual, human-like situation, caught in the act of what appears to be a late-night snack. The scene creates irony by portraying the initial fear giving way to a nonchalant recognition of the unexpected visitor. The absurd presence of the rhinoceros, treated as a known entity named Kevin, underscores the bizarre nature of the situation.",
