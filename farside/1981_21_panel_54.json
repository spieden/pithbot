  "description": "The image depicts a small Roman soldier standing behind the massive Trojan horse, suggesting he is physically holding it in place. This highlights the absurd notion of a single person managing such a colossal structure. The irony lies in applying a practical, physical constraint (holding something heavy) to a mythical military strategy. The surreal situation of one soldier needing to \"hold it until nightfall\" underscores the comic's absurd take on the legendary event.",
