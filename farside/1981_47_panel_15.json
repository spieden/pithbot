  "description": "In a butcher shop, two butchers stand behind a meat display case. One butcher, wearing an orange shirt and white apron, is speaking to a customer in a brown coat and hat. The customer's back is mostly to the viewer. The display case contains various cuts of meat, including what looks like ground meat with a price tag and several steak cuts. Two cuts of meat hang from the ceiling. The speaking butcher appears to be contemplating the value of his assistant, who is also wearing a white apron and purple shirt, holding a meat cleaver.",
