  "description": "A colossal whale faces a lone man in a small rowboat. The whale is depicted with speech bubbles emanating from its blowhole, illustrating a literal interpretation of the idiom \"talking out of one's blowhole,\" which means speaking foolishly. This creates an absurd and ironic situation where the massive sea creature communicates verbally from its spout, confronting a tiny human equipped with a small harpoon gun in the vast ocean.",
