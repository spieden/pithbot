  "description": "A zoo curator, having worked for 23 years in the snakehouse without incident, suddenly experiences an intense, overwhelming panic attack, described as a \"cumulative attack of the willies.\" This situation is notable for the delayed and cumulative nature of the fear, contrasting with the long period of uneventfulness in a potentially frightening environment. The scene depicts the curator visibly shaking, having dropped his mop and spilled a bucket of liquid, surrounded by glass enclosures containing snakes. The absurd concept suggests that anxiety can build up internally over a prolonged period before manifesting acutely.",
