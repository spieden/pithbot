  "description": "Three large amphibians are shown, two smiling widely and one with a unique, squinting expression. This visual disparity emphasizes individuality and difference. The absurdity comes from applying a phrase typically used for celebrating human or cultural diversity to these visually distinct creatures. The humor is derived from the unexpected juxtaposition of their appearance and the caption. This panel celebrates the concept of embracing variations, even among pond dwellers.",
