  "description": "A figure on a stage dramatically introduces 'the world's greatest escape artist'. In a room just off-stage, presumably the artist, identified as The Great Waldo, is shown desperately attempting and failing to open a simple door marked with a star. This juxtaposition creates stark irony, highlighting the absurdity of a supposed master of escape being defeated by a simple doorknob. The situation is novel in its mundane failure contrasting with the grand expectation.",
