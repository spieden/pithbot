  "description": "Two knights prepare to joust across a barrier. One knight's horse possesses a disturbingly wide, toothy grin and spectacles, presenting an absurd contrast to the medieval setting. The surreal appearance of the steed undermines the formality of the tournament. This bizarre creature introduces an element of unexpected, unsettling humor into the traditional joust. The scene highlights the disruption of the expected by the strangely grotesque.",
