  "description": "A colossal winged reptile resembling a pterodactyl soars through the air, carrying a small cow suspended by a rope from its talons, while another cow is tethered to a stake on the ground with a similar rope. Two primitive humans stand outside a cave entrance, gazing up at the scene with expressions of delight. This bizarre spectacle is being treated as a 'new bird feeder,' a concept incongruous with the setting and scale, where the intent appears to be attracting birds to consume large mammals. The setup presents a surreal inversion of typical bird feeding practices, utilizing prehistoric creatures and livestock in an absurd and dangerous manner.",
