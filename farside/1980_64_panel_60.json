  "description": "An Indigenous person, pierced by numerous arrows but alive, stands amidst a field of deceased cowboys also struck by arrows. The victorious individual bends to pick up a hat from the ground littered with cowboy boots and hats. This scene presents an absurd reversal of expectations, highlighting the surreal survival of the individual despite overwhelming injury. The pile of bodies and arrows creates a morbid, exaggerated landscape. An additional cowboy on a horse is visible in the background.",
