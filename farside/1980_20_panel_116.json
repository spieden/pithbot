  "description": "A horse dressed in human clothing, including a trench coat and hat, appears visibly distressed while walking away from a movie theater. The theater's marquee advertises 'GODFATHER'. An accompanying woman attempts to comfort the distraught equine, suggesting its reaction is disproportionate to a film. The scene creates an absurd and surreal image of an animal profoundly affected by a human drama, highlighting the comedic contrast between animal nature and complex human narratives.",
