  "description": "In a scene depicting the legendary Knights of the Round Table gathered around their famous table, King Arthur addresses his esteemed knights. The humor lies in the absurd contrast between the historical grandeur and the king's mundane complaint about them sticking gum under the table. This trivial, modern issue is applied to figures known for epic quests, creating irony and a sense of misplaced priorities in a legendary setting. The inclusion of specific knights like Lancelot and Galahad underscores the high status of those being admonished for a childish habit. A visible sword leaning against a chair subtly highlights the martial context, further emphasizing the absurdity of the king's domestic-style scolding.",
