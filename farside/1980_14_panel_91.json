  "description": "A large, muscular simian figure, wearing a lab coat and tie, is seated at a laboratory bench filled with scientific glassware, holding a test tube. Its face contorts with irritation as a shadowy figure knocks at the window of the adjacent door. The scene suggests a dramatic, possibly monstrous, physical transformation is occurring, juxtaposed absurdly with the common social inconvenience of being interrupted while one is not ready. The mundane act of waiting at a door is placed against a backdrop of surreal biological alteration. This highlights the ironic clash between everyday life and extraordinary scientific mishap or personal metamorphosis.",
