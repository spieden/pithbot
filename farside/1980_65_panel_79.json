  "description": "Four cavepeople are gathered near a cave entrance. Two seated individuals, identified as Zag and Thena, are being welcomed by two standing figures with open arms. The greeters issue a specific instruction: \"Come on in and act uncivilized!\" This command introduces irony, suggesting that even among cave dwellers, there is a deliberate act of shedding any veneer of refinement for social interaction. The situation is notable for its inversion of typical social etiquette, treating 'uncivilized' behavior as a state one chooses to adopt rather than an inherent condition.",
