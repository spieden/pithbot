  "description": "A large group of small, furry creatures are depicted cascading down a steep sandy incline towards the sea. The creatures at the forefront are plunging into the water, creating splashes. One creature further up the slope stands out by wearing a bright red and yellow inner tube. This scene portrays a collective, seemingly suicidal mass movement towards the ocean. The presence of the inner tube introduces an element of absurd preparation within this chaotic and fatal descent.",
