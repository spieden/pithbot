  "description": "The scene presents a suburban interior with a woman looking out a window at a taxi parked outside. The taxi's back seat is occupied by two cows, creating a highly unusual form of transportation for farm animals. This literal and absurd depiction plays on the common idiom, showing the unexpected 'arrival home' of the cows via a taxi. The woman's reaction suggests bewilderment at the bizarre sight unfolding in her front yard.",
