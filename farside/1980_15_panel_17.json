  "description": "A large, distressed woman stands in a doorway, hands raised in shock or horror. Below her, two boys sit on steps. One boy, wearing glasses, looks towards her while holding an empty bottle. The other boy, who is larger, lies on his back, holding a soda bottle with a straw, with his lip visibly sucked far into the bottle's neck. The scene depicts the absurdity of a boy physically deforming his face by sucking his lip into a bottle, presented with a straight-faced explanation from his friend, contrasting sharply with the mother's extreme reaction to this bizarre act.",
