  "description": "A clown in full costume is strapped into a large wooden guillotine. Standing beside the contraption is a man in an apron and cap, holding a lever device. A king, wearing a crown and a long red and purple robe, stands opposite the guillotine, arms crossed, observing the scene. The ground is a simple dark surface, and the background is a plain blue sky. The king's detached approval of the gruesome scene, specifically the execution of a clown, presents a darkly comedic and absurd juxtaposition of entertainment and death.",
