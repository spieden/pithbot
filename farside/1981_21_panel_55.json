  "description": "A pair of cave dwellers stands amidst an enormous pile of banana peels outside their cave entrance. One, holding a large spotted hide, declares they are finished with their task, while the other expresses dismay at the resulting mess covering the ground. This scene highlights the absurd scale of their activity (presumably consuming a vast quantity of bananas) juxtaposed with a relatable domestic complaint about cleanup. The irony stems from the primitive setting and extraordinary mess contrasted with the commonplace nature of the complaint. The ground is littered with countless banana peels, surrounding rustic wooden structures and a large disk-shaped object.",
