  "description": "A split view reveals men wading through water from above the surface and a large school of piranhas from below, gathered menacingly around the leg of one man. Bizarrely, this man is shown instructing the piranhas to wait for the signal 'Piranha!' before initiating their attack. The scene presents an absurd and surreal alliance between a human and predatory fish. The dark irony lies in the attack signal being the very exclamation one would make upon being attacked by piranhas.",
