  "description": "A caveman, dressed in a leopard-print loincloth, stands outdoors, striking himself in the forehead with a rake. The scene is set near a tree and a cave entrance, with scattered, disc-like objects on the ground. This depicts an ironic and absurd moment representing the initial, perhaps painful and clumsy, interaction with a newly discovered tool, contrary to the expected benefit.",
