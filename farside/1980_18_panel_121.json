  "description": "In the vastness of space, a sleek, rocket-like vehicle carrying four gleeful, green-skinned alien joyriders speeds past a lone, distressed human inside a classic American space capsule. One alien stands atop the vehicle with wind-blown tendrils, another leans out, while the driver and a passenger inside grin widely. The scene contrasts the human's predicament with the aliens' casual, almost suburban cruising, underscored by a nonsensical, perhaps dismissive, suggestion.",
