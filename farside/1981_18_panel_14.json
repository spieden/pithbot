  "description": "A cow stands on a wooden platform addressing a large crowd of other cows in a field, depicting a scene of bovine political action. This situation presents an absurd and surreal premise of cows organizing a revolution. Adding to the surrealism, one cow in the background appears to be stitched together like a patchwork creature. The revolution is announced as postponed due to having \"discovered a leak,\" an ironic pun playing on the literal meaning of a milk leak in cows versus the figurative meaning of a leak of information or structural failure. The panel derives humor from the juxtaposition of serious revolutionary language with the mundane, physiological reality of cows.",
