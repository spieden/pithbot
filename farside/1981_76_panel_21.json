  "description": "A conductor leading a classical musical ensemble covers his ears in distress. The musicians are playing various instruments, including cellos or basses, but one musician in the foreground is playing a banjo. The conductor's reaction emphasizes the unexpected and discordant nature of the banjo's sound in this setting. This creates an absurd situation and highlights the irony of the conductor being overwhelmed by the music he is leading. The scene captures the clash between traditional classical music and the unconventional inclusion of a banjo.",
