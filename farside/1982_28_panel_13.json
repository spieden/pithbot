  "description": "Three oversized birds, two of whom are wearing human clothing, stand in a doorway looking at a third bird inside a house. The floor of the house is completely blanketed in a thick layer of scattered newspapers.  This surreal scene blends human domesticity with avian nesting instincts, creating absurdity through the juxtaposition of the dressed birds' human-like arrival home and the bird-like use of the home's contents. The comment about the \"fresh newspaper\" adds irony, treating the plentiful nesting material as a domestic convenience.",
