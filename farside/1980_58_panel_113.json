  "description": "On a sunny beach under a large striped umbrella, two immensely large, blob-like figures lie side-by-side on a patterned blanket, appearing to sunbathe. One of the figures, with small eyes and a wide mouth, uses a flat, round object as a pillow while holding a can-like item; the other figure, with curly hair and sunglasses, rests beside them. A relatively small, thin man with glasses, a beard, and wearing a tank top and shorts stands a short distance away, addressing the reclining giants. The scene presents an absurd contrast between the ordinary beach setting and activity and the bizarre, oversized nature of the main figures.",
