  "description": "On a classic deserted island featuring a single palm tree, a castaway sits as the tree bends sharply away from him, suggesting it is actively trying to leave. This presents an absurd and ironic twist on the typical survival narrative, where the natural element meant to provide sustenance or shelter is depicted as sentient and abandoning the person in need. The scene highlights the ultimate isolation, as even the island's only plant seems to reject the inhabitant.",
