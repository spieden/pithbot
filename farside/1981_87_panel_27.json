  "description": "A large green dragon breathing fire expresses pain and discomfort, complaining to an unseen individual named Phyllis. The dragon appears to be reacting negatively to its own fire, which is engulfing a small figure in smoking armor. The scene presents an absurd reversal of the typical dragon-slaying narrative, where the mythical creature is vulnerable to heat and requires mundane remedies like hot pads, while the armored figure, presumably a knight, seems to be the source of irritation or pain for the dragon. A discarded sword and shield lie nearby, suggesting a struggle has already occurred.",
