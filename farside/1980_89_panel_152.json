  "description": "Two humans are attempting to hide from or blend in with a herd of bison by crouching under a bison hide in a grassy field. One human is whispering to the other, who is whistling, apparently undermining their camouflage effort. Several bison are nearby, including one in the foreground looking directly at the camera with a suspicious expression. The scene depicts the absurd attempt at disguise and the failure to follow simple instructions in a high-stakes situation.",
