  "description": "A fire lookout tower stands above a dense forest. Instead of a lookout, the platform supports a burning pyre of human figures, from which thick black smoke billows upwards. The structure designed to prevent forest fires is used as a platform for a contained blaze involving human remains. This macabre scene introduces a surreal twist to the mundane function of the tower. The irony lies in the source of the smoke not being a forest fire.",
