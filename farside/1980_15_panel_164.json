  "description": "A lumberjack is asleep leaning against a tree, with his axe resting on the log he was cutting. Two beavers are sitting near the log, seemingly observing the scene. The irony lies in the beavers, typically associated with chewing wood, being deemed 'edible' by the lumberjack, representing a shift in the natural order and the lumberjack's priorities from work to sustenance. The image presents a novel situation where the hunter (lumberjack) becomes potentially hunted (or eaten) by the prey (beavers), although the caption implies the lumberjack will now hunt the beavers.",
