  "description": "A woman in a blue dress is shown mid-fall down a wooden staircase. A white duck stands on the steps just above her, while another white duck is positioned at the bottom of the stairs. A framed portrait of a man in formal wear hangs on the wall beside the stairs. The scene presents an absurd scenario where domestic birds appear to be involved in causing a human's accident, suggesting a surreal conspiracy.",
  "caption": "As the first duck kept Margaret's attention, the second one made its move.",
