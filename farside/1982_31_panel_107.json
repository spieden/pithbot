  "description": "A woman stands inside a house, looking out a window at a rainy day, addressing two men who are also looking out. The two men have physical characteristics that resemble classic monster depictions: one is hunched over with a large head and prominent teeth, the other is tall and bulky with a furrowed brow and goatee. The woman suggests they go downstairs and 'build a monster,' creating an absurd irony given their monstrous appearances, implying this activity is a typical boredom cure for them on a rainy day.",
