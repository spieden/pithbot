  "description": "A woman is vacuuming her living room couch and discovers a man buried deep within the cushions. The man is partially visible, covered in debris, with his head and arm sticking out. The woman's reaction is one of mild surprise, noting his presence and also the unexpected discovery of her missing hairbrush alongside him in the couch's interior. This highlights the absurdity of finding a person inside furniture, treated with the same casualness as misplacing an everyday object.",
