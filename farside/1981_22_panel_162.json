  "description": "A painter stands before an easel, working on a portrait of a fierce-looking lion with sharp teeth and claws. The artist, holding a palette and brush, is depicted from behind, revealing deep claw marks raked across his back. The scene is set in a studio space with large, segmented windows in the background. The image highlights the ironic contrast between the artist's formal pursuit of capturing a wild subject and the dangerous, visceral reality of obtaining inspiration or reference from such a creature. The extensive injuries on the painter's back suggest a perilous method was employed to achieve the realistic depiction of the lion.",
