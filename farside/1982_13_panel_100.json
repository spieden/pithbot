  "description": "A man is seated at his desk, speaking on the telephone, while outside his window, another man is being forcefully thrown from a building, trailing a telephone receiver and cord amidst shattered glass and debris. A thought bubble above the man at the desk shows a telephone operator asking if he will accept a collect call. The proposed caller's name, Mr. Aaaaaaaaaa, is a prolonged sound that mimics a scream of distress. This creates an absurd juxtaposition between a routine request for a collect call and the violent, chaotic event occurring simultaneously outside.",
