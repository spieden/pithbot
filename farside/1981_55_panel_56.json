  "description": "Two figures are visible inside the lantern room of a lighthouse at night, reacting with evident annoyance. A figure resembling a superhero, complete with cape and boots, is flying in the beam of the lighthouse's searchlight, circling it repeatedly. The flying figure appears disoriented or bothered by the bright light, leaving a trail behind it. This interaction between a powerful, flying being and a standard navigational aid creates a situation of absurd inconvenience for the people operating the light. Their reaction suggests this unusual disturbance is a recurring problem disrupting their duty.",
