  "description": "In a grassy field, an injured centaur lies on the ground while a distressed female centaur looks on. A figure resembling a human doctor, holding a briefcase, examines the fallen centaur. The doctor's assessment and proposed solution, treating the mythical creature's broken leg as a reason for euthanasia typically applied to animals like horses, underscores the absurd clash between the creature's human and animal halves and the inappropriate application of veterinary practices to a being also possessing human characteristics.",
