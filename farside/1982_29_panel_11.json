  "description": "A flock of birds is shown landing on and standing atop an urban skyscraper roof. Several birds on the roof display human-like confusion and agitation. The scene depicts a migratory flock having apparently taken a wrong turn during their journey. This creates an absurd situation of wildlife navigating into an unnatural, built environment. The juxtaposition of instinctual migration with a navigational error and urban arrival provides a specific instance of irony.",
