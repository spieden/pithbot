  "description": "Figures are depicted attacking covered wagons on a plain. One attacker yells specific instructions, demanding the attack proceed in a \"counterclockwise\" direction. This introduces an element of absurd precision into the chaotic and violent scene of an assault. The irony lies in the rigid adherence to a seemingly arbitrary directional rule during a desperate conflict. This specific command subverts the expected portrayal of a spontaneous or tactically fluid attack.",
