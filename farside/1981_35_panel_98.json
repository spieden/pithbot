  "description": "A postman struggles to fit a large object into a standard residential mailbox. His attempt becomes increasingly desperate, culminating in his entire body being consumed by the small metal box. The mailbox then signals completion by raising and waving its small red flag. This depicts a surreal and absurd inversion of roles, where the container receives the deliverer. The scene offers an ironic commentary on the interaction between humans and inanimate objects, specifically the improbable outcome of a struggle against a mailbox.",
