  "description": "Skis and poles stand upright in the snow at the edge of a slope. Large animal paw prints lead from near the abandoned equipment up the snowy incline towards a dark opening in a rock face, suggesting an abrupt and possibly dangerous encounter. The scene depicts the sudden interruption of a recreational activity by the presence of a large, unseen creature. The juxtaposition of leisure equipment and ominous tracks implies a hasty retreat.",
