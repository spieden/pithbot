  "description": "Three prehistoric figures are adrift on a small log raft in the water. An albatross flies overhead, prompting one of the figures to lament the perceived bad luck it represents. The humor stems from applying a specific superstition (related to the Rime of the Ancient Mariner) to figures in a seemingly desperate, primitive survival situation, highlighting the absurd juxtaposition of ancient hardship and a very specific, literary bad omen.",
