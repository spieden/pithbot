  "description": "A man holding a butterfly net stands in a field of flowers, facing a small wooden stand. Behind the counter, another man is visible, standing amongst jars containing butterflies. A sign above the stand advertises 'BUTTERFLIES $1.00 ea.', creating an absurd commercial scenario. The situation is ironic as the man with the net, presumably a butterfly catcher, is being told he must now purchase what he typically seeks in the wild. This highlights a surreal inversion of the natural order, where freedom is replaced by commodification.",
