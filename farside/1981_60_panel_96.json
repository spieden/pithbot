  "description": "Two individuals, heavily bandaged and in wheelchairs, sit in a grassy field engaged in conversation. Overhead, a massive, pockmarked asteroid plummets towards the ground, casting a large shadow. The scene creates a surreal and absurd situation by contrasting a casual discussion about extremely rare past misfortunes with the imminent, catastrophic arrival of a cosmic body. This juxtaposition highlights the theme of escalating, improbable bad luck reaching a level of cosmic irony. The peaceful field setting serves as a stark contrast to the impending, world-altering event.",
