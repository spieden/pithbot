  "description": "Under a starry night sky, a lone traveler sits by a campfire next to a covered wagon, unaware of hidden observers. Two figures lurk behind rocks, reacting with fear to sounds heard in the darkness. One figure urgently corrects the other's panicked misidentification, revealing the noises are simply bird calls. The absurdity lies in their terrified reaction to common avian sounds, starkly contrasting with their position observing a potential target. This moment captures the tension and misinterpretation possible in clandestine observation.",
