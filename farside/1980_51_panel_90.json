  "description": "A runner is surprised and assaulted by a street cleaner vehicle whose rotating brush is aggressively sweeping the sidewalk directly in their path, kicking up debris. The driver of the vehicle observes the scene from the cab with a wide, malevolent grin. This presents an ironic and absurd conflict where a maintenance vehicle targets a pedestrian with excessive force, highlighting a surreal interaction between infrastructure and individual activity. The runner, wearing a numbered bib, is trapped between the wall and the encroaching brush. The vehicle is labeled as 'STREET CLEANER NO. 3'.",
