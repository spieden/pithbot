  "description": "Two soldiers are positioned in a trench, with a line of enemy helmets visible over a distant ridge. One soldier is receiving instructions while holding a grenade. The command is specific: pull the pin, throw the grenade, but crucially, refrain from yelling 'Heads!' This implies a previous instance where the soldier inappropriately warned the enemy during an attack. The scenario creates dark irony by injecting sports etiquette into a battlefield context, highlighting a bizarre form of incompetence.",
