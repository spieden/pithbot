  "description": "In a macabre setting resembling a dungeon, a masked figure points towards a man stretched on a rack, presenting it to an elderly couple as if giving a casual demonstration. The scene is populated by other figures also appearing confined, including a man chained to a ball. The surreal juxtaposition of a horrific torture device being showcased as a normal exhibit for tourists highlights the absurd and darkly ironic nature of the situation.",
