  "description": "A figure in classic spy attire, including a trench coat and dark glasses, is poised to strike from behind a house's downspout under the cover of night. Their target, two slugs, one uniquely possessing three eyes, are unaware of the impending danger. The assassin's weapon is revealed to be a container of ordinary salt, transforming a common garden pest control method into a surreal, absurdly dramatic operation. This highlights the dark humor in portraying a miniature ecosystem's peril with the tropes of espionage and targeted elimination.",
