  "description": "Two large bears are nestled together in a dark cave, surrounded by scattered bones. While one bear rests peacefully, the other lies wide awake, eyes wide open, unable to sleep. The situation presents an ironic subversion of natural instinct, as one of the bears is frustrated by its inability to enter a state of hibernation. This common biological process becomes an impossible task for the restless animal.",
