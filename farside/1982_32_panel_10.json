  "description": "A large man carries a chicken towards a wooden chopping block, holding an axe. Three other white chickens stand watching in the foreground of the grassy scene. The central absurdity is the anthropomorphic perspective revealed, where one chicken reflects on its impending fate. It expresses a preference for a quick, quiet end, without the usual frantic running. This ironic statement satirizes the grim reality by applying human-like concerns about decorum to the moment of slaughter.",
