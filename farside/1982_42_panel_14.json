  "description": "A stern-looking sheriff confronts a person mounted on a horse outside a sheriff's office. The mounted person wears an exceptionally tall hat. The sheriff informs the person that the town has a 'hat-check law' and instructs them to remove the distinctive headwear slowly. The scene presents an absurd situation where a trivial and peculiar law regarding headwear is strictly enforced by the authority figure in a setting that resembles a frontier town.",
  "caption": "\"Hold it right there, stranger. We got us a hat-check law in this town ... so just take it off niiiiiice and slow.\"",
