  "description": "An abnormally proportioned father sits in an armchair, addressing his equally strange-looking young son, who sits on his lap. The mother, also unusually depicted, stands beside them with a duster. The father delivers a serious message about the son's origins. The irony stems from the fact that the son bears a striking resemblance to the father, making the revelation of adoption absurd.",
