  "description": "A figure in bed is being told goodnight and cautioned against bedbugs, a common phrase. However, the irony and dark humor lie in the literal and monstrous bedbug, whose large, green leg protrudes from under the bed. The presence of the giant insect under the bed transforms the familiar saying into a surreal and terrifying reality within the domestic setting. This juxtaposition of a mundane ritual with a bizarre, threatening creature highlights the absurdism of the situation. The person in bed appears visibly anxious about their impending slumber.",
