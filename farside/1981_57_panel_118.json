  "description": "Two robed figures, one wearing glasses and chained to the other, stand together in a dimly lit room with a staircase behind them. The figure with glasses expresses affection for a third robed figure nearby, who is characterized by striking lipstick and eyelashes. Despite their physical proximity and the literal chain linking them, the speaker feels completely unnoticed by the object of their affection. This presents an ironic scenario where spectral beings are physically bound yet emotionally invisible. The absurdity stems from these unusual figures experiencing the very human pangs of unrequited love and the feeling of being overlooked.",
