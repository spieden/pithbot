  "description": "A person's head is secured in a guillotine's lunette, while their bound body kneels behind the device. A sign or speech bubble ironically announces the lethal apparatus as \"NEW AND IMPROVED!\" The scene presents a darkly humorous juxtaposition of deadly execution technology with consumerist marketing language, highlighting the absurdity of applying notions of improvement to an instrument of death. This surreal situation underscores the dark irony of progress in the context of state-sanctioned violence.",
