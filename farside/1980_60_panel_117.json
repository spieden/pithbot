  "description": "A large bird is shown sneezing, expelling liquid from its beak. Below the bird, underground, a group of worms with startled expressions react. The scene presents an absurd situation where potential prey (worms) might extend a human social courtesy to their predator (the bird). The irony lies in the politeness offered across species and predator-prey lines, highlighting a surreal inversion of typical natural interactions.",
