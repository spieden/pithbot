  "description": "Giant, silhouetted rabbits hold up puppet-like human figures, casting imposing shadows on a plain white background. Below the shadowy forms, two smaller, realistically drawn rabbits sit and look up, mimicking the posture and apparent actions of the immense figures by holding up their own paws. This surreal scene creates an ironic contrast between scale and reality, suggesting a world where immense, shadowy entities manipulate human forms while smaller, real creatures are influenced by their phantom actions. The uncanny mirroring of behavior across different scales and realities is the central, distinguishing element.",
