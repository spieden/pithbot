  "description": "The scene takes place inside a surreal store that sells disembodied heads and masks as merchandise. Two figures resembling the Lone Ranger and Tonto are browsing the selection, with several grotesque heads hanging from the wall and masks displayed on a shelf. One figure holds up a mask while the other, wearing a distinct cowboy hat and eye mask, considers the options. The situation portrays a bizarre marketplace where iconic faces and identities are treated as goods to be purchased or replaced. This creates an absurd scenario where familiar heroes are reduced to customers in a shop selling literal heads, highlighting themes of identity as a commodity.",
