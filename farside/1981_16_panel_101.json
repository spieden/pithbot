  "description": "Two primitive figures attempt to transport a substantial log. One figure exerts effort by pushing the heavy trunk directly. The other figure utilizes a long rope attached to the log, pulling it by running rapidly in the opposite direction of desired movement. This peculiar method of applying force creates an ironic contrast between effort and efficacy. The scene highlights an absurd approach to a simple task.",
