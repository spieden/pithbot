  "description": "A large, inflated cow is performing a high jump over a bar supported by two poles planted in tires. A cat sits below, playing a violin, seemingly providing background music or rhythm for the cow's attempt. Another figure, possibly human, observes the scene from the left. The setup appears makeshift and the participant is highly unusual for such an activity, highlighting an absurd and surreal training regimen.",
