  "description": "A large man holding a harpoon sits at a bar next to a smaller man wearing a \"SAVE THE WHALES\" shirt. The man with the harpoon responds to a comment about white whales by stating they have plenty of them. This exchange creates a sharp irony between the environmentalist's plea and the whaler's casual, dismissive attitude towards the abundance of a specific type of whale. The presence of the harpoon alongside the conservation message in a common setting like a bar underscores the clashing perspectives in an absurd juxtaposition.",
