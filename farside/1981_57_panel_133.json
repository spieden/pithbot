  "description": "A large, shaggy creature with small eyes and a long, tubular snout looms over the ground. A line of ants marches nearby, while others inhabit a conical mound. An ant on the mound reacts with wide eyes and frantic gestures, seemingly shouting a warning. The warning describes the predator's feeding method using the dramatic phrase \"sucking death.\" This portrayal creates an absurd contrast between the natural event and the ants' human-like panic and hyperbolic language.",
