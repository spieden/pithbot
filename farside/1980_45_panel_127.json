  "description": "Two large albatrosses fly over a vast ocean containing a ship. One albatross expresses exasperation, claiming the ship has been pursuing them for days. This reverses the traditional literary trope where an albatross is a burden or bad omen to a ship. The birds perceive the ship as a persistent stalker, highlighting the absurdity of their perspective. This scenario presents a surreal role reversal in the dynamic between marine birds and seafaring vessels.",
