  "description": "An extremely large individual is sitting directly on top of a smaller person on a beach near the water's edge, crushing the person underneath. The smaller person is flattened and distorted by the immense weight. The larger individual, oblivious or unconcerned about the person they are sitting on, is looking into the distance and commenting on a mosquito. This presents a darkly humorous and absurd scenario where a mundane observation is made in the face of a physically impossible and life-threatening situation.",
