  "description": "A cowboy on horseback holds a large gramophone horn aloft under a starry sky and full moon. He attempts to use this archaic sound amplification device while herding a dark mass of cattle. The cattle are depicted as black silhouettes with only their eyes glowing brightly in the dark, creating a surreal effect. This scene presents an absurd method applied to a common task, highlighting the irony of using a passive, old-fashioned device for herding.",
