  "description": "The scene depicts a fort under siege, with arrows flying over and embedding in the wooden palisade.  However, several of the incoming projectiles are arrows tipped with plunger-like objects, presenting an absurd form of attack. The defenders, visible peering over the fort walls, react with weary exasperation, specifically lamenting the return of these particular assailants.  This highlights the surreal nature of the conflict, suggesting a history of dealing with this bizarre and likely ineffective siege method.  The focus is not on the threat itself, but the sheer ridiculousness of the recurring attackers and their peculiar weaponry.",
