  "description": "A human figure is imprisoned in a large, green padded birdcage hanging from the ceiling of a room. Simultaneously, a white bird with a large eye and prominent beak is shown flying away from the cage. The interior setting includes a patterned sofa, a small table with a vase of flowers, and a rug. This scenario presents an absurd and ironic reversal of typical roles, where the bird is free while the human is confined. The bird's successful escape from the human's captivity highlights the surreal nature of this unusual predicament.",
