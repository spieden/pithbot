  "description": "Medieval knights on horseback ride through a stormy landscape under a looming moon. A striking bolt of lightning connects with the tip of one knight's lance, causing a large, multi-pointed electrical discharge. Both the knights and their horses exhibit exaggerated, wide-eyed expressions of shock and fear. This image creates an absurd juxtaposition of medieval warriors and their archaic weapons with the overwhelming, raw power of nature. The surreal scene highlights the vulnerability of human conflict tools when faced with the unpredictable forces of the environment.",
