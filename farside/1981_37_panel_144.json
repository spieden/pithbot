  "description": "This panel depicts a classic angry mob scene, but with an absurd twist: the target is two individuals playing incredibly loud instruments, a banjo and a tuba, late at night. The mob wields traditional tools of outrage like pitchforks and bats, but also includes a surreal, giant flaming matchstick. The scene highlights the extreme and disproportionate reaction to a common annoyance, playing with the trope of the pitchfork-wielding villagers against something perceived as disruptive or unusual.",
