  "description": "The scene depicts a medical consultation where an overweight patient, Mr. Farnsworth, is being examined by a doctor. The patient presents with a surreal condition: small, anthropomorphic cows are physically attached to his head, shoulder, and leg. The doctor is delivering a diagnosis based on these bizarre, visible manifestations. The core irony lies in the medical professional diagnosing a literal case of 'having cows,' transforming a common idiom for agitation into a bizarre physical ailment within the clinical setting.",
