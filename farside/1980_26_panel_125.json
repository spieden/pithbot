  "description": "Two people are shown tumbling backward over a large waterfall in a raft. One person wears glasses and has their mouth open in surprise or fear, raising their arms. The other person is mostly submerged, also raising their arms. Several large salmon are actively jumping upwards over the waterfall, appearing to successfully navigate the rushing water. A single paddle floats horizontally in the air above the raft. The environment is a river with rocky banks, clouds, and turbulent water at the base of the falls.",
