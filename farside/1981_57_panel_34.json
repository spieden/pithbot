  "description": "In a bedroom scene at night, a man in bed expresses frustration towards his wife, who is sitting on the edge with hair rollers. The specific point of contention is the wife placing her cold feet on him. The man adds an absurdly specific demand: if she must put her feet on him, they should at least be dry first. This interaction escalates a common marital annoyance into a moment of specific, slightly unpleasant absurdity, focusing on the unexpected condition of wet feet.",
