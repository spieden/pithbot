  "description": "A man is upside down at the ship's wheel, losing his hat, while a spyglass flies through the air. Another figure falls backward on the deck, and a third tumbles down a set of stairs, past a rolling barrel. This scene of utter disarray aboard a ship is paired with the caption \"Columbus discovers America.\" The panel's absurd depiction of discovery as a series of clumsy accidents provides an ironic contrast to traditional heroic narratives.",
