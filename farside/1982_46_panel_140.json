  "description": "Three figures identified as Old Man Winter, River, and Higgins sit on a bench. Old Man Winter appears as a barefoot figure in simple clothing, River wears full scuba gear including mask, snorkel, and flippers, and Higgins reads a newspaper while smoking a pipe. The scene presents an absurd situation where abstract concepts or names are embodied in unexpectedly mundane and bizarre ways. The irony lies in the clash between their identities and their appearances and setting.",
