  "description": "A male elephant lounges glumly in an armchair, watching television in a cozy living room. He clutches a beverage can as a human woman, holding a plate and towel, stands behind him with a look of irritation. The scene portrays an absurd domestic situation: an interspecies marriage between an elephant and a human. The elephant expresses regret over this unusual union, highlighting the inherent incompatibility and dissatisfaction within their surreal relationship. This highlights the theme of marital discord through a highly unusual and literal representation of incompatible partners.",
