  "description": "A man in a brown suit and hat walks past a white picket fence holding a briefcase. In the yard of the house beyond the fence, there are two signs: one reads 'BEWARE OF DOG' and the other, closer to the sidewalk, reads 'DDS OK'. The man is presumably a dentist, indicated by the 'DDS OK' sign, which ironically exempts him from the usual 'BEWARE OF DOG' warning, playing on the common fear of dentists versus the typical fear of dogs.",
