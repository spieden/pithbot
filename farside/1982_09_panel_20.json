  "description": "Two figures in white robes, resembling traditional ghosts, stand on outdoor stairs holding small horns. They appear to be attempting to haunt or be spooky, but their method involving musical instruments is failing. They discuss the ineffectiveness of their current approach and decide they need to obtain chains. This situation is absurd and ironic, depicting ghosts who are not naturally equipped with the stereotypical tools of haunting and must acquire them like mundane objects.",
