  "description": "A brick building labeled as a 'Crisis Clinic' is depicted on fire and precariously sliding off a cliff edge, about to plunge over a large waterfall. This presents a stark and absurd irony, as the institution meant to handle crises is itself in a state of extreme, cascading disaster. The scene visualizes the concept of overwhelming problems leading to total collapse, using a dramatic and surreal environmental setting.",
