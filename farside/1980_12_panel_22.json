  "description": "A nervous performer in a tuxedo and cape stands before a target board with a person tied to it, holding knives. The target board and the air around the bound person are adorned with dollar signs, indicating the performance's focus is on monetary gain derived from the dangerous act. Several knives are already embedded in the board and the person, yet the audience is cheering and appears highly entertained. The performer's visible anxiety contrasts sharply with the audience's enthusiastic reaction to the potentially fatal spectacle. This highlights the absurdism of profiting from extreme risk and the dark, almost predatory nature of the audience's enjoyment.",
