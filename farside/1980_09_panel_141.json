  "description": "Police officers question a man seated in a large armchair, while a severed arm and legs are visible protruding from beneath it. Nearby, a parrot on a perch vocally repeats phrases including a panicked interjection, suggesting it overheard events related to the crime. The scene creates dark humor through the absurd juxtaposition of a casual interrogation with the clear evidence of dismembered remains. The parrot's fragmented speech provides an ironic commentary, potentially revealing the suspect's actions or the discovery of the body.",
