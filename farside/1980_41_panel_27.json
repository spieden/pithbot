  "description": "In a scene mimicking a covert stakeout, two figures in trench coats conduct an exchange in a doorway while two men in a car observe. The item being exchanged is a duck, substituting a mundane object for illicit goods typically involved in such clandestine operations. One of the observing men in the car communicates via radio, escalating the absurdity by treating the duck exchange with the urgency of a serious crime. The situation presents a surreal twist on police procedural dramas, highlighting the contrast between the intense surveillance and the trivial nature of the 'contraband'.",
