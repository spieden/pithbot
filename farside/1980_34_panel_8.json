  "description": "In an alleyway beside brick walls and trash cans, a large, human-sized cockroach sits next to a man in a hat holding a bottle. Another man is asleep on the ground nearby. The scene presents an absurd situation where a giant insect interacts like a person, highlighting themes of identity and perception through surrealism. The irony lies in the implied reason for the cockroach's state, suggested by the text below the panel. This bizarre depiction uses the literal transformation into an insect as a metaphor for being reduced to a single, negative label.",
