  "description": "A woman escapes a burning building by jumping towards a rescue net held by firefighters. Instead of a safe landing, she bounces forcefully off the net. Her trajectory sends her soaring back upwards, higher than the building she just left. This presents an absurd situation where the intended rescue device becomes a catapult, highlighting a dark irony in the failure of safety measures during a crisis.",
