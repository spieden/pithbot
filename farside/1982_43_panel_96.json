  "description": "A figure wearing a raincoat and hat, with a fish tail visible, sits on stone steps carved into a cliff face, observing several orange fish leaping up a large waterfall. The surreal scene depicts a fish-like being in human attire watching other fish attempt a natural, instinctual migration against a powerful current. The juxtaposition of the figure's human-like posture and clothing with its fish tail, combined with its detachment from the struggle of its kin, creates a sense of absurdity and irony.",
