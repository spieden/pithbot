  "description": "Two mosquitoes fly over a landscape of rolling, textured hills, which are depicted as vast terrain from their perspective. This surreal environment represents human skin, with the hills being pores or bumps magnified. The irony stems from the dramatic shift in scale, portraying human skin as a depleted resource being surveyed for sustenance by the tiny insects. The mosquitoes' conversation implies a history of heavy feeding activity in this 'place'.",
