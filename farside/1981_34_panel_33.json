  "description": "A person shows a projected image of a monstrous, sheet-like figure holding a staff to an audience. This figure is identified as an old peasant woman who placed a curse on the speaker for taking her photograph. The absurdity lies in the physical manifestation of the curse's source as a projected image and the severe consequence for a simple action like being photographed. The casual recollection of receiving a curse for being 'snapped' underscores the surreal humor. The audience's fearful reaction contrasts with the speaker's calm demeanor.",
