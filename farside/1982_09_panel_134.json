  "description": "The panel depicts a large cape buffalo partially obscured by tall grass, with a tic-tac-toe grid marked on its rear. The seemingly deadly game of encountering a wild buffalo is satirically recontextualized as a trivial board game played directly on the animal. This juxtaposition of the dangerous reality of African wildlife with the mundane absurdity of tic-tac-toe creates a sense of irony and surrealism. The image subverts expectations about both hunting and games, presenting a novel and unexpected scenario.",
