  "description": "A seemingly ordinary act of feeding birds escalates rapidly into a surreal and absurd situation. An old man sitting on a park bench is first surrounded by a few pigeons, then many, until he is completely overwhelmed and covered by a massive flock. The final panel reveals the bench empty, save for his hat, glasses, and coat, implying a bizarre disappearance or consumption by the birds, highlighting the ironic and darkly humorous consequence of a simple interaction with nature.",
