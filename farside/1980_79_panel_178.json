  "description": "This panel presents a surreal scene where a newly constructed snowman violently attacks its creator, grabbing the builder's head and arm. Two onlookers passively observe from a nearby window, one engrossed in reading while the other appears startled by the unexpected confrontation. The irony lies in the traditional image of snowman building being subverted by the snowman's aggressive behavior. The stark contrast between the innocent activity and the sudden violence highlights the absurd nature of the situation. The footprints leading directly to the attack site emphasize the inevitability of this bizarre encounter.",
