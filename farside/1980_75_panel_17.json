  "description": "Two heavily armored knights sit by a campfire, using their swords to roast marshmallows, blending medieval military gear with a modern camping activity. Behind them stand two horses, also armored with partial caparisons. A notable red sack lies beside one knight, labeled with a dark, anachronistic joke connecting the marshmallows to a famous historical figure's tragic end. This juxtaposition of the mundane and the martial, coupled with the morbidly humorous product name, creates a scene rich in absurd irony and surrealism.",
