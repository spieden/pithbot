  "description": "Two lions are depicted in a savanna environment, with one commenting to another about a third lion walking away. The critique delivered is that the departing lion is a \"nice guy\" but suffers from \"zebra-breath.\" This anthropomorphic judgment applies a human social standard (bad breath) to a natural predatory consequence (eating a zebra), highlighting the absurd juxtaposition of human social niceties with animal behavior. The irony lies in the predator being criticized for the smell of its legitimate prey.",
