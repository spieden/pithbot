  "description": "A group of woodland animals is celebrating the birthday of a bear wearing a hat marked 'SMO', implied to be Smokey Bear. The birthday cake features burning evergreen trees as candles, creating a darkly ironic situation given Smokey Bear's well-known fire prevention message. The bear covers his eyes, asking if he can look, highlighting the absurd presentation of a burning forest on his celebratory cake.",
