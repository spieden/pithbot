  "description": "A large group of rats is gathered around a giant mousetrap, raising their hands in what appears to be a religious ceremony. An anthropomorphic piece of cheese with eyes sits on the trap's bait pedal. A rat wearing a headdress and necklace sits on a pedestal above and behind the trap, seemingly leading the ritual. The scene depicts the ironic worship of an object designed to kill the worshippers, highlighting the absurd nature of devotion to temptation.",
