  "description": "Three figures in the foreground, viewed from behind, wave goodbye to a lone figure walking away up a road over a hill. The foreground figures include a woman in a bonnet, a large person in a wide-brimmed hat with an arm around the woman, and another large person in a tall hat and overalls, all with arms raised in farewell. The figure in the distance, wearing overalls and a hat, also waves while carrying two sticks. The scene takes place in a rural landscape with rolling hills and fields, with a glimpse of a building on the right.",
