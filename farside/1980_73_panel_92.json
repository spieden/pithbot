  "description": "Prehistoric people in inflatable rafts on a river are annoyed by approaching neighbors in another raft. The humor stems from the absurd juxtaposition of primitive characters using modern recreational equipment and complaining about a mundane, suburban-style problem like neighbors borrowing something, especially water in an environment where it is abundant. The situation highlights the timeless nature of petty social annoyances, transplanted into an anachronistic setting.",
