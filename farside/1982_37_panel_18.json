  "description": "A witch relaxes in bed, her room adorned with framed art and a nightstand sculpture featuring broomsticks. She is engrossed in a book, open to a page displaying another illustration of a broomstick. This environment portrays an unusual domestic reverence for the witch's primary tool of flight. The scene presents an absurd depiction of a magical practitioner treating her broom with the same artistic and literary appreciation one might reserve for hobbies or interests.",
