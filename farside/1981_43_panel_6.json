  "description": "A heavily armored procession of warriors marches towards a castle, their intimidating appearance undercut by their visible annoyance. A small, persistent red animal follows them along the path, creating an absurd contrast between the serious military endeavor and a domestic nuisance. The humor arises from the mundane problem of a pet disrupting a seemingly significant march. The warriors' helmets reveal exasperated expressions as one calls out to a member named Richard about his dog.",
