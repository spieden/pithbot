  "description": "A vintage gramophone plays music represented by floating musical notes. Two large snakes stand upright on their tails, their bodies contorted in a manner suggesting they are attempting to dance. One snake appears to be instructing the other in a dance that combines structured 'steps' with their natural 'slithering' movement. The situation presents an absurd juxtaposition of an animal known for fluid ground movement trying to execute a rhythmic, upright dance routine to recorded music.",
