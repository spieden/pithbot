  "description": "The scene is set in a Western town with two figures seated on a porch observing a third figure descending from the sky. The airborne figure, wearing spurs, is arriving over the rooftops towards the street in front of the building. The seated figures, dressed in Western attire, appear calm despite the highly unusual method of arrival, with one commenting on the newcomer's identity. This surreal element of flight in a typical Western setting provides an absurd juxtaposition.",
