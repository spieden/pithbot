  "description": "On a desolate shore, a large, scaly creature with webbed feet emerges from the water carrying a human woman draped over its shoulder, her high heels trailing in the shallow water. In parallel, a human diver in full gear sits in the water, holding a large speared fish, also presumably heading toward the land. The scene presents an absurd inversion of common fishing or mythological narratives, placing both human and aquatic-like beings in unusual, mirrored roles relative to the water's edge and their 'catch'.",
