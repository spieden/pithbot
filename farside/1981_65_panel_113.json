  "description": "A massive bird looms over the ground, its head tilted down as if observing or interacting with something below. Unbeknownst to the bird, directly beneath it, a group of tiny, helmeted figures are engaged in strenuous mining work within a subterranean passage. One figure uses a pickaxe to excavate, while others push a mine cart overflowing with spherical objects, creating a stark and absurd contrast between the scale and activities of the surface creature and the hidden underground laborers.",
