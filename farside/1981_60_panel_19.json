  "description": "A group of fearsome Vikings is gathered around a table for a feast, with crossed swords mounted on the wall behind them. One seemingly mighty Viking is depicted struggling intensely to open a small jar of mayonnaise. This scene creates irony by contrasting the Vikings' powerful warrior image with their inability to perform a simple, mundane task. The presence of mayonnaise at a Viking feast adds an element of anachronistic absurdism to the setting.",
