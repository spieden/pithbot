  "description": "A scientist is seated behind a Frankenstein's monster and the Bride of Frankenstein, who are sitting awkwardly on a couch. The scientist has his hands on their shoulders and is looking at them expectantly. The environment behind them suggests a laboratory setting with beakers and tubes on shelves, mixing the domesticity of the couch with their origins. The scene highlights the absurdity of a creator attempting to force a romantic connection between two beings he physically assembled, suggesting that chemistry and compatibility are not simply manufactured.",
