  "description": "A massive, spiky stone idol representing the deity Goran looms over two spear-carrying figures sitting on steps. The scene depicts a moment of waiting or rest during a week of religious sacrifices. The humor arises from one figure expressing relief that it is Friday, applying a modern sentiment of workplace exhaustion to the grim task of appeasing a fearsome god through ritual killing. This juxtaposition of the mundane and the brutal highlights the absurdity of their situation and the novel deity, Goran.",
