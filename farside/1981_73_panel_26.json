  "description": "The scene presents bears with unusually dense, fluffy fur, one of whom lies on its back on a striped mattress while another sits and observes. The surreal level of fluffiness on the bears, particularly the one on the mattress being presented for viewing, creates an absurd scenario. The bear's pose on the mattress is strangely human-like, adding to the surrealism of a potential 'fluff' competition or display.",
