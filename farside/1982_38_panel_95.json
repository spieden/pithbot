  "description": "A caveman, wearing a leopard-print garment, lectures an audience of other cavemen inside a cave, pointing with a stick at a large drawing on a scroll depicting the tail of a dinosaur with prominent spikes. The lecture involves formally naming a specific part of the dinosaur's anatomy, the tail spikes, after an individual, which is an absurd projection of modern scientific practices into a prehistoric setting. The specific term used, \"thagomizer,\" is a real paleontological term for the spike arrangement on a stegosaur's tail, humorously originating from this very concept. The scene presents a novel situation of early humans conducting an anatomy lesson on dinosaurs with formal nomenclature.",
