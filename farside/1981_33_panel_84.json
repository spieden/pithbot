  "description": "The scene features three prehistoric figures in a stark, rocky environment. A tall, thin figure on the left stands over two shorter, stout figures on the right, holding a large spherical stone raised above its head. The two figures on the right huddle together, each cradling a large spherical stone in their arms. The humor derives from the primitive context applying a modern idiom, where having a weapon poised to drop is literally 'having the drop' on someone. This specific situation is notable for its literal interpretation of the phrase using prehistoric tools.",
