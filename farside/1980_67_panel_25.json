  "description": "In a dim tomb, an explorer wearing a hat, holding a cane and a flashlight, stands beside an open sarcophagus. Inside the sarcophagus, a mummy, wrapped in bandages and topped with a bow, appears to be sitting up and looking at the explorer. A second, closed sarcophagus stands nearby. The scene presents an absurd encounter between an ancient deceased figure and a modern visitor, subverting expectations of archaeological discoveries.",
