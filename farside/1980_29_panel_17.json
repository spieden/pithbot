  "description": "A massive herd of safari animals, including giraffes, elephants, rhinos, and ostriches, stampedes towards a fenced-off NASA facility. A large rocket stands ready for launch within the compound. A military policeman inside a guard booth frantically reports the approaching animals over the phone. The scene presents an absurd clash between the natural world and a high-security space program environment. The guard's call highlights the surreal and unexpected nature of the event.",
