  "description": "A crying snake holding a flower approaches a mournful face emerging from a hole in the ground. An extraordinarily long, dotted carpet with a fringed end stretches from the snake to the hole. This surreal scene depicts an absurd ritual or visitation, where grief is expressed through an unexpected interaction between peculiar characters and objects. The formality of the carpet contrasts sharply with the bizarre participants and setting.",
