  "description": "An older woman with glasses and a headscarf is watering a patch of ground with a hose. From the ground sprout various items, including bags or objects with handles resembling garden tools, a vacuum cleaner, and an iron. Small signs are placed next to some of the items, one depicting a vacuum cleaner and another an iron, suggesting these household appliances are being cultivated. The scene presents a surreal vision of gardening where inanimate objects are treated as growing plants.",
