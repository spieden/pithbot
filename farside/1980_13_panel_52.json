  "description": "A woman prepares to deploy a monstrous, multi-limbed creature labeled \"Dogaway\" by shoving it out a window with a plank. Outside, dogs are already fleeing in terror from an unseen presence. A man reads instructions, oblivious to the creature's immediate effect and the extreme nature of this dog deterrent. The scene presents an absurd, literal interpretation of scaring dogs away using a terrifying, surreal entity.",
