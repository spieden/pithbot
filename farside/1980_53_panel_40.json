  "description": "The image depicts Noah's Ark listing severely to one side, with Noah and various animal pairs struggling to maintain balance on the deck. The extreme tilt of the large vessel suggests a significant imbalance of weight.

This highlights the irony of a biblical-scale event being affected by a common ailment among the passengers.",
