  "description": "A two-headed man in formal attire stands on a stage, using a megaphone and pointing with a stick. He is presenting a seated, one-headed individual to a large audience, all of whom also possess only one head. The scene subverts the typical sideshow dynamic by presenting normalcy as the extraordinary spectacle to those who are themselves normal. The irony highlights the arbitrary nature of what is deemed unusual or incredible.",
