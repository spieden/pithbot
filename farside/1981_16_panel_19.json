  "description": "The scene depicts two cowboys on horseback dramatically charging towards the edge of a sheer cliff, about to plunge over the precipice. Below them, at the base of the cliff face, a man in a suit sits composedly on a stool playing a grand piano. The imminent, violent action above is set against the unexpected and tranquil musical performance below. This surreal juxtaposition creates a sense of absurd detachment or an unconventional audience for impending doom. The presence of a piano and pianist at the bottom of a cliff while cowboys fall from the top is a distinguishingly novel situation.",
