  "description": "Two snakes are in bed at night, illuminated by moonlight streaming through a window. One snake is tied in a tight knot near its middle and is screaming in pain or surprise, its eyes wide and mouth open. The other snake is partially covered by the blanket, looking towards the distressed snake with a sleepy, annoyed expression. This presents an absurd scenario where a legless creature experiences a 'Charley horse,' manifesting as a literal knot in its body, highlighting the surreal application of a human ailment to a non-human form.",
