  "description": "The finals of a competition titled 'Mr. Nose' are underway, featuring contestants and an audience all distinguished by their exaggeratedly large noses. A participant wearing the number six stands prominently on a podium, while others, including one with the number three and another with twelve, are present. The formal setting with a banner and applauding crowd provides an ironic contrast to the absurd premise of judging individuals based on this extreme physical characteristic, creating a surreal spectacle.",
