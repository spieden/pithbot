  "description": "Two cows observe a dense group of human runners on a road beside their pasture. One cow voices a fear of being trapped in a box canyon with the approaching crowd. This expresses an absurd inversion of typical predator-prey dynamics, with the large animals fearing the smaller, faster mass. The specific fear of a box canyon emphasizes a sense of being cornered and overwhelmed. The situation offers a surreal perspective on human activity from an animal's viewpoint.",
