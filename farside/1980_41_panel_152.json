  "description": "A large baby sits in the sand next to a towering sandcastle. Bubble wands extend from the sandcastle, blowing bubbles which appear to be launched towards the baby, while a small object is shown hitting the baby's head, causing a visible reaction. The situation presents an absurd scenario where playful bubbles and an unseen projectile become minor irritants or attacks directed at the baby from the inanimate structure, highlighting a surreal moment of beachside discomfort.",
