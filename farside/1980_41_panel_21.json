  "description": "A crowd of people with raised hands surrounds a platform carrying two men toward a large, monstrous stone structure with a fiery mouth. The structure appears to be an altar or deity figure, suggesting a ritualistic offering or sacrifice is taking place. One of the men being carried, seemingly unaware of or detached from the grim reality, compares the situation to being celebrated heroes in a football game. This comparison creates a strong sense of dark irony and absurdism, contrasting impending doom with trivial sports fame. The scene depicts a bizarre blend of primitive ritual and modern, mundane perspective.",
