  "description": "The scene features two figures in a primeval forest observing a third figure near a cave. One figure advises the other to approach the third with caution, emphasizing the need for recognizable courtship behavior. The warning highlights an absurd juxtaposition: the primitive threat of being eaten is mitigated only by successful social signaling. This creates irony by contrasting brutal survival instincts with the nuanced concept of courtship recognition.",
