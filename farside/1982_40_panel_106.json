  "description": "A fly in a checkered suit and bowtie stands at a microphone on a stage, addressing an audience composed of bulbous forms that resemble large piles of garbage or trash bags. The speaker points to the audience as they introduce members who came from the dump, creating irony by placing creatures associated with refuse in a formal speaking setting. The scene is absurd, depicting flies and animated trash attending a public address, satirizing human social gatherings through the lens of insects and their environment.",
