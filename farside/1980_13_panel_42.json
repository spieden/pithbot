  "description": "Two monstrous figures are depicted in a domestic setting. One sits comfortably reading a newspaper, while the other stands in a doorway, expressing frustration. The humor derives from the juxtaposition of their grotesque, non-human appearance with a mundane, human-like marital argument. The specific complaint about 'flaring nostrils' adds a layer of absurdity to the everyday conflict, highlighting the incongruity between their appearance and their relatable, petty grievances. The scene is notable for portraying domestic life through the lens of the grotesque.",
