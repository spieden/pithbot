  "description": "On Noah's Ark, Noah addresses a group of animals including giraffes, zebras, bears, and cheetahs. A dismembered leg, clearly belonging to a unicorn, is visible behind Noah. This surreal scene suggests that the unicorns, contrary to the biblical account, did not survive the journey, presumably due to the carnivores onboard. Noah's subsequent decree to confine all carnivores to 'C' deck highlights the dark humor and practical difficulties of housing all species together. The presence of the unicorn leg is a specific, distinguishing detail that grounds the absurdism in the familiar narrative.",
