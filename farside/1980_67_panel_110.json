  "description": "In a snowy Arctic landscape with ice floes in the water, two polar bears are depicted. One large polar bear is actively biting into and eating a section of a constructed igloo made of snow or ice blocks, causing pieces to break off. Another polar bear sits nearby, observing the first bear's actions. The scene presents the absurd and surreal notion of a polar bear consuming a human-built ice structure as if it were food.",
