  "description": "A prehistoric hunter stands over a gigantic, speared mammoth alongside a smaller figure, likely his child or subordinate, expressing frustration. The absurdity lies in successfully hunting such a massive creature only to face the daunting, parental-like challenge of making someone eat it. The scene presents the ironic contrast between the triumph of the hunt and the mundane, domestic-style conflict over consumption. The sheer scale of the dead mammoth, impaled with multiple spears, highlights the difficulty of the task ahead. The environment is a sparse landscape with scattered rocks and tufts of grass.",
