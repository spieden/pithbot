  "description": "A woman holds a treat out to a parrot in a cage, while a large, severed hand descends from above the window. The scene presents a surreal juxtaposition of a mundane domestic activity with an absurd, gigantic appendage. The parrot appears excited, raising its claws, seemingly anticipating something more than the small treat offered by the woman. This visual absurdity provides a literal and dark twist on a familiar phrase.",
