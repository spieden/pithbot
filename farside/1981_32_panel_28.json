  "description": "This scene portrays the finals of a competition centered on nasal characteristics, held in an arena-like setting with a banner announcing \"MR. NOSE FINALS.\" One competitor, wearing jersey number 6, stands on a podium, seemingly the victor, facing a cheering audience. Two other competitors, wearing numbers 3 and 12, are visible nearby. The event is treated with the gravity of a major sporting final, despite the unusual basis for judging. The distinguishing large noses of the participants are central to the premise.",
