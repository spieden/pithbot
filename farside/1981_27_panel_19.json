  "description": "Two figures plummet from a cliff marked \"LOVER'S LEAP,\" their hat and shoes trailing behind them. Perched on the cliff edge in a nest are two bird-like creatures. The scene creates dark irony by applying the concept of a tragic romantic suicide spot to a literal, fatal fall. The absurdity is heightened by the contrast between the dramatic cliff name and the mundane act of creatures leaving a nest, which the caption connects to the falling figures.",
