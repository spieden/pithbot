  "description": "In an operating room, several surgeons are gathered around a patient on an operating table beneath a surgical light. One surgeon is addressing the others, proposing a vote to determine the number of chambers in the heart during the procedure. The scene highlights the absurd and unsettling situation of medical professionals lacking fundamental anatomical knowledge during a critical surgery. The humor derives from the profound incompetence implied by the need to vote on such a basic fact.",
