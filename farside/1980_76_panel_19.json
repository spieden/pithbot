  "description": "A woman sternly confronts a man holding a long lighter, with smoke rising between them, while another person's legs are visible on a table in the foreground. The woman declares that this act warrants the punishment of the man only receiving decaffeinated coffee from now on. The scene presents an absurd domestic conflict where a seemingly minor transgression (lighting a cigarette) leads to a disproportionately severe and specific consequence. The humor lies in the ridiculousness of the punishment and the exaggerated reaction to a common habit.",
