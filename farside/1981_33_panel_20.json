  "description": "A human with a surfboard runs towards the ocean on a sandy beach alongside a large, bipedal green creature. The creature is enthusiastically carrying a small red toy wagon instead of a surfboard. The crashing waves behind them contrast with the figures' eagerness for their peculiar activities. This scene presents an absurd juxtaposition of traditional beach recreation with a surreal participant and his unusual equipment.",
