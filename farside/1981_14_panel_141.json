  "description": "A frog, illuminated by a spotlight, attempts to catch flies stuck to a hanging fly strip using its tongue. This presents an absurd scenario where a natural predator targets prey caught in a human trap. The situation highlights an ironic conflict between the frog's biological instinct and the artificial nature of the fly strip. The frog's long tongue, usually effective, is rendered useless against the sticky paper. The scene's absurdity lies in the frog's persistent, yet ultimately futile, effort in this unusual environment.",
