  "description": "In a bedroom setting, a large, hairy creature with prominent tusks lies awake in bed, while a smaller, winged creature attempts to sleep beside it. The scene is unsettlingly domestic, featuring furniture like a bed and nightstand, yet juxtaposed with the bizarre inhabitants and an ominous open door leading to a dark stairway. The smaller creature expresses frustration at the larger one's persistent fear of noises downstairs, creating an ironic contrast between their monstrous appearance and mundane, relatable domestic squabble about paranoia.",
