  "description": "Two figures, one with a long beard and glasses, and another with shaggy hair, are seated in a highly decorated boat on the sea. The boat features a duck head prow and is adorned with smiling fish, stars, and a crescent moon. After seven days adrift, the irony lies in their relief at not having been seen, suggesting they are deliberately avoiding detection rather than seeking rescue, an absurd situation given their predicament.",
