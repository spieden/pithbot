  "description": "A giant ladybug is panicking, with sweat drops flying from its head and its eyes wide, as a tiny, bespectacled human in a suit sits calmly on its back. The creature's mouth is open in distress, and its large legs are splayed. This presents an absurd reversal of scale and typical fears, where the massive insect is terrified of the minuscule human passenger.",
