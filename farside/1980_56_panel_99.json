  "description": "The scene is a corporate office where a large executive, smoking a cigar, sits behind a desk across from a small, shabbily dressed man seated on a chair. Suspended from the ceiling above the desk is a gigantic pencil, its sharpened point hanging over the executive. The absurd scale of the pencil in the mundane office setting creates a surreal environment, satirizing the idea of a company being dominated by its product. The executive's question, posed under this enormous symbol of the product, adds irony to the sales pitch scenario.",
