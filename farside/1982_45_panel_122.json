  "description": "Two large bears are preparing what appears to be a meal, shaking small human-like figures from a tree. One bear holds several figures, while the other shakes the tree trunk. The dialogue treats the arrival of more figures as merely adding another guest to a gathering, highlighting the absurd indifference to the figures' fate. This juxtaposition of mundane conversation with a predatory act creates dark humor. The scene is set in a clearing with a single tree and discarded surgical implements.",
