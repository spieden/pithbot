  "description": "In a kitchen setting, a live lobster is suspended in front of a bullseye target while two chefs throw baseballs at it. This surreal scene transforms a typical culinary environment into an arena for an absurd game. The inversion of the lobster's usual fate, from being prepared for consumption to being a target, creates a strong sense of irony. Scattered baseballs and what appear to be eggs litter the floor, emphasizing the unusual nature of this activity. The setup presents a disturbing form of entertainment rather than food preparation.",
