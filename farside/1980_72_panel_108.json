  "description": "A taxi driver is in his car with a passenger who has pointed ears, small horns, and a goatee, resembling a demon. The driver looks back at the passenger with an angry expression while gripping the steering wheel. The passenger, wearing a hat and coat, appears to be giving directions. The scene suggests the driver is reacting strongly to being told to drive the demon passenger to 'there', implying a location like Hell. This creates an absurd situation by combining the mundane act of taking a taxi with the surreal passenger and destination.",
