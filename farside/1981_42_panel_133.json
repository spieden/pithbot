  "description": "A gathering of beavers focuses on one among them who notably lacks the large incisor teeth typical of their species. The situation becomes absurd as a beaver vocalizes repeatedly about this missing feature. This highlights the irony of a group defined by a physical characteristic being fixated on its absence in one member. The grassy environment and trees serve as a typical habitat backdrop for this unusual observation.",
