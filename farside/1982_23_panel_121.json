  "description": "A couple confronts a witch in their home after a babysitting job went terribly wrong. The parents are bewildered, having hired the witch for childcare, only to find she has apparently cooked and consumed their children. This scenario satirizes the classic fairy tale trope of witches eating children by placing it in a domestic, modern context. The parents' stunned reaction and the witch's presence with a large spoon highlight the absurd contrast between a typical babysitting arrangement and the gruesome outcome. The environment is a normal home setting, making the fantastical event particularly jarring.",
