  "description": "A large, submerged creature with sharp teeth and one eye visible above the water has a small island with a palm tree growing on its head.  Two people in a small boat paddle towards the 'island,' one holding a spear and the other two with arms raised in apparent relief or excitement.  The creature's massive body is mostly hidden beneath the water's surface.",
