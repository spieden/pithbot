  "description": "In a hospital room, two figures in surgical attire stand over a patient in a bed connected to medical equipment, including an IV and a heart monitor. One figure instructs the other to ensure the patient receives copious amounts of ice cream upon recovery. This scene presents a stark contrast between the serious medical environment and the trivial, indulgent post-operative instruction.",
  "caption": "\"Well, that should do it. ... When Mr. Warner comes around, make sure he gets all the ice cream he wants.\"",
