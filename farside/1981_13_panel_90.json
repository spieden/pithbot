  "description": "A military truck transports a large, smoking missile down a rural road. Despite the immense and immediate danger posed by the potentially active weapon, a sign on the truck's rear bumper displays a mundane traffic safety message. This creates a sharp, absurd contrast between catastrophic potential and trivial precaution. The smoking missile implies it is active or malfunctioning, heightening the surreal nature of its public transport. The scene underscores a darkly humorous irony regarding perceived versus actual safety concerns in the context of military power.",
