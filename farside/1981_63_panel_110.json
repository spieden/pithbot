  "description": "Defenders on a castle wall are firing arrows at a wheeled siege tower positioned near the wall. The wooden tower is heavily damaged, with numerous arrows embedded in its structure. Several Vikings are shown running away from the tower, clutching swords and shields, while one Viking peeks fearfully from the top. Arrows are depicted mid-air, flying towards the tower from the direction of the castle wall. The scene depicts the ironic failure of the siege equipment, forcing the attackers into a panicked retreat.",
