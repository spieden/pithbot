  "description": "Vikings in a longship at sea, under a dramatic sky, experience the mundane reality of their journey. Two Vikings at the stern look out as others row, including some surprisingly thin and less imposing figures, contrasting with the fierce dragon head prow. The irony is revealed in the feeling that despite their effort and the formidable ship, they may simply be lost and going in circles. This highlights the absurd potential for even grand endeavors like Viking voyages to devolve into pointless, repetitive tasks.",
