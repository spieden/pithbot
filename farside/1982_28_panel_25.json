  "description": "A prehistoric man, clad in a leopard-print loincloth, sits cross-legged on the sand before two small piles of dark stones, a large rock formation looming behind him. With a look of distress, he holds one stone in his hand, seemingly trying to count or calculate with the pebbles arranged on the ground. This depiction humorously presents the modern concept of math anxiety in an absurdly primitive setting, suggesting that mathematical struggle is an ancient human affliction. The scene highlights the irony of a caveman grappling with numerical concepts using rudimentary tools. The combination of the primitive environment and the specific psychological state creates a novel and slightly surreal situation.",
