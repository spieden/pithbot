  "description": "A heavy rainstorm batters the landscape outside a dark cave entrance where three wet, primitive humans huddle. Two distinct, dog-like creatures stand exposed to the downpour at the cave mouth, looking inward. One of the humans instructs another, identified as Arnold, to remain resolute against the animals seeking refuge. The expressed concern is that granting shelter a single time would establish a persistent expectation from the wild creatures. This scene reveals an ironic application of complex, precedent-based reasoning to a simple act of compassion in a primitive environment.",
