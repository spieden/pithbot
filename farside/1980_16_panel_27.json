  "description": "A portly figure sits hunched over a table, intently reading a book titled \"YOU CAN BECOME SOMEONE!\". He is framed by a dense, dark crosshatching that suggests a restrictive or perhaps underground environment. The aspirational title of the book contrasts sharply with the figure's appearance and the seemingly confining atmosphere. The scene depicts a poignant, perhaps futile, attempt at self-improvement within perceived limitations. The absurdity lies in the setting under which such a self-help book is being earnestly consumed.",
