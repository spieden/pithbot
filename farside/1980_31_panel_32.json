  "description": "A figure rides a camel through a vast desert landscape, with a pyramid visible in the distance under a featureless sky. Strapped to the camel's back is a rolled banner revealing the rider's inner desire. The text on the banner presents a stark contrast between the arid, landlocked environment and the activity of sailing on water. This juxtaposition creates a sense of irony and quiet absurdity, highlighting the rider's longing for escape from their current, harsh reality to a preferred, entirely different setting.",
