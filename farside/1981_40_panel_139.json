  "description": "Two primitive figures are in a stream, using large rocks to beat fabric against smaller rocks, seemingly performing laundry. One figure is sweating from the exertion of using a large spotted boulder. The other figure, adorned with a bone in his hair, performs the same task. This scene depicts the arduous and seemingly experimental nature of early human domestic chores, specifically laundry using rocks. The accompanying statement suggests the method's effectiveness for clothing contrasts sharply with its results on a different subject.",
