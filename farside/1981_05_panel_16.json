  "description": "Two sheep ride a ski lift up a snowy mountain towards a lodge. Above the lodge, a massive avalanche is cascading down, emitting loud rumbling sounds.

This juxtaposition of mundane bodily sounds with the terrifying reality of an avalanche creates a darkly humorous and absurd situation.",
