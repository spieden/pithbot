  "description": "The scene features an elderly human woman and an elderly anthropomorphic goat, complete with glasses, beard, horns, and smoking a pipe, sitting together in rocking chairs on a porch or steps outside a house. A notable object is the pie visible on the windowsill in the background. The situation presents an absurd domestic pairing of different species as if they were a long-married couple. Irony is central as the woman uses the common insult \"old goat\" directly to an actual goat, literalizing the phrase in this surreal context. This literalization of a figurative expression within an imagined reality provides the source of humor.",
