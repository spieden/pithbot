  "description": "A primitive hunter is depicted running across a landscape, actively tracking footprints. The figure carries a spear and wears a loincloth, but is also equipped with headphones connected to a portable stereo device strapped to their waist. This juxtaposition of prehistoric activity with modern technology creates an absurd and ironic scene, highlighting a humorous clash between different eras and lifestyles.",
