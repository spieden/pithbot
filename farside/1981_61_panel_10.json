  "description": "Three cowboys on horseback are cornered by a dense herd of large, grim-faced cattle. In this tense confrontation, one cowboy incongruously suggests they sing \"Happy Trails.\" The suggestion is acutely ironic, juxtaposing a cheerful farewell song with their immediate and possibly terminal danger. This creates an absurd scene where conventional trail-end serenity is replaced by bovine menace.",
