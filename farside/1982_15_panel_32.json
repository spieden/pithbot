  "description": "Ants are attempting to drag an enormous human infant towards their tiny anthill entrance. The scene presents a surreal struggle against an impossible disparity in size and weight. One ant, positioned at the anthill's opening, expresses exasperation at the lack of progress. This highlights the absurdity of the ants' monumental and futile task and the oblivious nature of the giant baby being moved.",
