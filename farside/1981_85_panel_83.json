  "description": "On a dark, starry night under a full moon, a series of footprints ascends a textured hill. The tracks at the bottom are narrow and elongated, resembling human footprints, while those further up the slope transition into wide, webbed shapes characteristic of a duck. This sequence visually depicts a bizarre transformation process occurring under the lunar influence, implying the presence of a creature that changes from a human-like form into a duck, an absurd twist on traditional lycanthropy.",
