  "description": "Two ants observe a large, undulating mass of humans moving across the landscape. One ant expresses concern, noting that a fellow ant named Bobby Joe is foraging in the direction of this overwhelming group. The panel employs scale disparity to create irony, portraying a human stampede as a hazardous environment for the seemingly mundane ant activity of foraging. This highlights the absurd vulnerability of tiny creatures navigating a world dominated by much larger, unaware beings.",
