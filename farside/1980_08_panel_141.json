  "description": "A figure resembling Noah is shown hammering nails into a large, freestanding stone archway, not a boat. A variety of animals, including giraffes, elephants, ostriches, and dogs, stand waiting at the base of the structure, looking confused and expectant. The builder is shouting upwards, seemingly frustrated, while the animals appear oblivious to the imminent danger of a flood and the uselessness of the architectural arc being constructed instead of a vessel.",
