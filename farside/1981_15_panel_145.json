  "description": "A figure with wings and a halo, wearing overalls and a hat, uses a cane to examine a bitten apple on the ground. A snake coils in the branches of the tree above the fruit. This celestial being, visually impaired, physically probes the scene of the transgression. The combination of divine symbols with earthly attire and a cane presents an absurd image. The scene suggests a mundane investigation into a moment of profound cosmic consequence.",
