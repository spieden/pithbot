  "description": "A large sign advertising \"EAT\" is hung over the planet Earth, illuminated like a roadside diner marquee in the vastness of space. A futuristic spaceship is piloted by grotesque, sharp-toothed alien beings, one of whom looks out towards the Earth. The scene presents the entire planet as a mere food source, highlighted by the absurd and simplistic advertising. This treats Earth as a cosmic restaurant, ready for consumption. The aliens' appearance and their seemingly casual desire for a meal add to the surreal setup.",
