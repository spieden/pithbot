  "description": "A man in a checkered jacket stands on a stage with a microphone and saxophone, pointing towards a couple in the front row of the audience. He is instructing the couple that when he says the word 'chicken,' they must stand up and make clucking noises. The audience members seated at tables have distinctive, somewhat exaggerated features. This scenario presents an absurd form of audience participation, subverting conventional performance expectations and highlighting the surreal nature of the interaction between the performer and specific individuals in the crowd.",
