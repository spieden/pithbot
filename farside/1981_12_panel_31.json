  "description": "A large crowd of individuals, some with peculiar features, gathers for a demonstration, carrying three blank protest signs.  They collectively hold a prominent banner displaying text that is oriented upside down.  The banner boldly declares the group to be the \"IMBECILES of AMERICA,\" presenting a striking image of self-deprecation and societal commentary.  The scene on the ground is marked by discarded items, adding a touch of realism to the otherwise absurd situation.  The blank signs amplify the sense of ironic pointlessness in their stated identity.",
