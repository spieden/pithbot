  "description": "In an \"Ocean World\" type setting, a trainer stands on a high platform holding a small fish for marine mammals. While two dolphins appear to be waiting for the fish, a large orca surfaces, expressing a predatory desire not for the offered herring, but for the trainer himself. This subverts the typical feeding dynamic and highlights an absurd, darkly humorous reversal of roles and expectations in a public performance setting.",
