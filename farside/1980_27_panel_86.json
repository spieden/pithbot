  "description": "A couple in a small fishing boat is surrounded by killer whales, easily identified by their prominent dorsal fins and distinct black and white markings, with one killer whale close enough to show its teeth. The woman excitedly points at the dangerous marine mammals, mistakenly believing them to be porpoises. This misidentification creates a sharp irony, as she perceives a benign encounter while facing imminent peril from apex predators. The scene highlights the absurdity of their blissful ignorance in the face of overwhelming natural power.",
