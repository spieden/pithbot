  "description": "A large vulture carrying a bone flies over a desert towards a group of smaller birds, also holding bones. The smaller birds are gathered around a sign that reads \"YES! WE'RE OPEN!\". This presents a macabre scene where vultures are seemingly operating a business related to scavenging or bones. The use of a commercial phrase like \"We're Open!\" in this context creates an absurd and darkly humorous situation.",
