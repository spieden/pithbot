  "description": "Three figures in striped prison uniforms are attempting to tunnel to freedom by digging through the sea floor deep underwater. One figure, reaching towards the surface, exclaims they feel the first drop of rain. This highlights the absurd and surreal nature of their escape attempt. Their belief they are nearing the surface is ironic given their underwater location, emphasized by fish swimming above them. The scene plays on the desperate hope of escape in a fundamentally impossible environment.",
