  "description": "In an operating room, several surgeons gather around a patient, one holding up a live porcupine with a surgical instrument. A bright surgical lamp illuminates this bizarre scene. The presence of the porcupine inside the abdomen is an absurd and surreal medical finding. The situation offers a darkly humorous, literal interpretation of abdominal pain caused by sharp quills. This unexpected discovery provides a novel explanation for the patient's condition.",
