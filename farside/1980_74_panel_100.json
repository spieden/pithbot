A moose sits on a stump, appearing to be the one providing the audio entertainment. The other animals display expressions ranging from attentive curiosity to outright amusement, with a rabbit rolling on the ground laughing.

It highlights a surreal dynamic where the natural world is detached and entertained by the struggles of humanity within its domain.",
