  "description": "Two figures are engaged in an unusual nocturnal pursuit in a swamp. One figure uses a spotlight to illuminate a large frog. The frog is notably wearing a green suit, adding a layer of surrealism to the scene. The method employed involves blinding the frog with light, a technique typically used on animals, applied ironically to this human-like creature. This juxtaposition of standard procedure with an absurd target creates dark humor.",
