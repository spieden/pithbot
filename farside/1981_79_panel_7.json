  "description": "A snake is perched atop a peak covered in snow under a starry night sky with a large moon. The cold-blooded reptile's presence in this freezing environment is inherently absurd. The sound \"HISS! HISS! HISSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS...\" emanates from the snake, perhaps expressing discomfort or simply the only sound it knows how to make in this unusual situation. This juxtaposition of creature and environment highlights a moment of surreal, out-of-place existence.",
