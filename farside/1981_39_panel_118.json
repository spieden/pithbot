  "description": "In a nest high up in a tree, a regal-looking eagle sits next to its three expectant chicks. Its mate arrives, perched on the edge of the nest, holding a single, small worm in its beak. The first eagle looks disdainfully at the offering while its mate looks sheepish. The scene highlights the absurd contrast between the image of a powerful predator and the reality of its meager catch for the family. The speaking eagle's comment underscores the irony of the situation.",
