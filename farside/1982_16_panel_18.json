  "description": "A Viking longship is shown on the water, with a dramatic sky overhead. Several Vikings are rowing. Two large, imposing Vikings stand at the stern. Some of the rowing Vikings are muscular, while others are skinny with exaggerated, goofy expressions. The ship has a detailed dragon figurehead. One of the standing Vikings is speaking to the other.",
