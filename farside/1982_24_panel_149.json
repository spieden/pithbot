  "description": "A large man sits comfortably, leaning back in a chair, while speaking intimately to a snail perched on his arm. The man addresses the snail as \"Jimmy,\" imbuing the mollusk with a human identity and relationship. The surreal situation is heightened by the man recounting a classic human origin story, claiming the snail was found under a cabbage leaf. This absurd application of human narrative and familial roles to a garden creature creates a sense of irony and highlights the peculiar perspective presented.",
