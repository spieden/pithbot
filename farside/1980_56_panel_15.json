  "description": "Two vampire-like figures stand over a third, frail creature seated on a park bench at night under a full moon. The seated creature, holding a cane and wearing a hat and glasses, appears old and impoverished. One standing figure leans towards the seated creature with an outstretched hand, while the other, larger figure stands back with arms extended. The scene presents an absurd and ironic situation where vampires attempt to gain something from someone who appears to have nothing, literally depicting the futility implied by a common idiom.",
