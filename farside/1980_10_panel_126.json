  "description": "An ordinary mailbox is depicted with a sinister, watchful gaze. Instead of mail, skeletons and bones overflow from its base, suggesting it has consumed those who have interacted with it. A woman approaches with a letter, seemingly unaware of the danger or the macabre history implied by the remains. The scene presents an absurd and dark inversion of the mailbox's function, creating a sense of surreal dread and ironic humor. The juxtaposition of a mundane object with horrific consequences is a distinguishing feature.",
