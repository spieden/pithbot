  "description": "In a primitive cave dwelling, a large cavewoman frantically swings a fly swatter at an unseen pest while addressing a smaller caveman who is calmly chewing a bone. The scene is set against a backdrop suggesting a cave entrance, with a large, stylized insect or prehistoric mosquito visible in the background. The irony lies in the cavewoman's modern complaint about the lack of 'screens,' a technologically advanced solution completely out of sync with their prehistoric environment and actions. This creates an absurd juxtaposition of primitive existence and modern grievances, highlighting the timeless frustration with pests but through an anachronistic lens.",
