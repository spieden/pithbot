  "description": "A businessman in a suit is being pulled down into the ground next to a wooden fence. He is reaching upwards, losing his hat and briefcase which is floating slightly above his hand. A sign on the gate next to him reads \"DANGER! CARNIVOROUS LAWN,\" indicating the surreal threat posed by the environment itself. The situation is absurd, presenting a mundane suburban element, the lawn, as a deadly entity. This twists the expectation that danger would be hidden behind the fence, locating it instead directly underfoot.",
