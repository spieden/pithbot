  "description": "Two whales are shown partially submerged in the ocean, engaged in a conversation. The larger whale, identified as Eddie, is being asked a question by the smaller whale about his capacity to consume college students. This scenario presents a surreal and darkly humorous twist on the typical predator-prey relationship by introducing humans, specifically college students, as potential prey for whales, creating an absurd juxtaposition with the mundane dialogue and marine environment.",
