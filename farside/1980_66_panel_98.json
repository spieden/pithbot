  "description": "Two vultures perch high on a large saguaro cactus overlooking a figure lying face down in the sand near a small puddle of water in a desolate desert. One vulture ironically whispers that they are in luck because the prone figure apparently does not see them. This presents an absurd scenario where scavengers worry about being spotted by potential carrion. The scene contrasts the harsh, dry environment with the small, reflective pool. The figure's outstretched arm and position suggest exhaustion or demise.",
