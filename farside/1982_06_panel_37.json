  "description": "Behind an opening door, a large shaggy monster and a smaller one with pointed ears lurk. The large monster tells the other to \"shove off\" because he's been \"working this neighborhood for years.\" This presents an ironic turf conflict between terrifying creatures, reducing their nature to a mundane business dispute. The scene is absurd, depicting monsters concerned with territorial work routes.",
