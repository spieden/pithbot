  "description": "Two people relax in deck chairs on a ship, one smoking a pipe, the other holding a drink. A life preserver hanging above them is labeled with the ship's name. The couple's complaints about the ship's service are presented against the backdrop of the name of a notoriously ill-fated vessel, creating dark irony. Their mundane dissatisfaction becomes absurd when contrasted with the ship's historical destiny. This juxtaposition underscores the theme of misplaced concerns in a dire situation.",
