  "description": "A deep-sea diver stands on the ocean floor, his air hose extending upwards. Multiple oversized scissors are descending along the hose, poised to sever it. This presents an absurd and surreal threat in the deep-sea environment. The mundane action of cutting becomes a life-threatening peril for the isolated diver. The diver looks up in astonishment at this unexpected danger.",
