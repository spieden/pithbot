  "description": "A rodeo clown bullfighter is pinned beneath a large bull in the arena dirt. Meanwhile, another clown bullfighter, partially concealed inside a protective barrel, shouts excitedly. He believes his presence in the barrel has somehow \"gotten\" the bull, ironically misinterpreting the situation where his colleague is clearly at the mercy of the animal. The scene is absurd due to the hidden clown's detachment from reality and his self-congratulatory reaction to another's peril.",
