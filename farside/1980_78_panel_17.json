  "description": "Two large, anthropomorphic dogs in formal attire walk away from a house at night while two other anthropomorphic dogs stand on the porch steps, seemingly saying goodbye. The departing female dog wears a red patterned coat and a pearl necklace, adorned with flowers on her head, and appears frustrated. The male dog accompanying her wears a brown suit, white shirt, and striped tie, and looks sheepish with his eyes half-closed under a fedora hat. The dogs on the porch are also dressed, with the female wearing a red dress and the male a plaid shirt and jeans, appearing somewhat disappointed or awkward, highlighting the absurd contrast between their human-like social interaction and the caption's revelation of a distinctly animal behavior causing the social distress.",
