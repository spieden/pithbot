  "description": "A man in a hang glider is being pulled into the enormous intake of a jet engine. Two pilots are visible in the cockpit of the jet, looking down with expressions of alarm. The scene depicts the absurd and dangerous situation of a slow, human-powered craft encountering the powerful vacuum of a large aircraft engine. The vast size difference between the hang glider and the engine intake emphasizes the impending peril. This surreal encounter highlights the inherent conflict and potential for disaster when vastly different forms of aviation share the same airspace.",
