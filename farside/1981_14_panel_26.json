  "description": "The scene depicts a group of prehistoric cave people gathered inside a cave, some holding drinks. One person is formally introducing two others using full names and a specific, anachronistic job title. The humor lies in the juxtaposition of primitive setting and people with modern social formalities and the use of 'Hunter and Gatherer' like a profession, highlighting the absurd application of contemporary concepts to the distant past.",
