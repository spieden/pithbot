  "description": "A sleeping person is depicted in their bed at night, dreaming. The dream, visualized in a thought bubble, shows a surreal scene contrasting the traditional method of counting sheep to fall asleep. Instead of leaping over a fence, multiple sheep lie incapacitated on the ground while a single sheep rushes towards a large brick wall. This presents an absurdist inversion of a common sleep aid, highlighting a struggle or inability to find rest.",
