  "description": "On a gallows platform built over water, one executioner patiently instructs another, using terms like \"rabbit goes through the hole,\" on how to tie the hangman's noose. Below, the bound victim watches with terror from the ground. The scene presents dark irony by applying mundane, step-by-step instructions normally used for simple tasks to the grave act of preparing for an execution. This juxtaposition of the commonplace with the lethal creates a sense of absurdism. The focus on the technicality of the knot rather than the grim reality underscores the surreal nature of the situation.",
