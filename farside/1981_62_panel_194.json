  "description": "The surreal scene depicts a lumberjack standing on a recently cut log in a forest. A bright beam of light descends from above, illuminating him and the log. Two winged figures, resembling angels, are shown descending within the light, reaching towards the lumberjack. This otherworldly intervention suggests the tree is being claimed or taken, adding an absurd cosmic dimension to the act of logging and creating unexpected irony.",
