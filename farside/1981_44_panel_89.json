  "description": "Three small figures are hidden within the deep contours of an oversized, olive-green armchair, peering intently at a book. The peculiar choice of reading material, titled 'Little Women', is held open by the central figure. This juxtaposition of diminutive men concealed inside furniture reading a classic novel about women creates an absurd and ironic scenario. A small table next to the chair holds a vase of simple daisies, adding to the domestic setting which contrasts with the unusual activity occurring within the furniture.",
