  "description": "Four primitive figures are depicted in a rocky landscape. Three figures are hunched over on all fours, appearing ape-like and using their hands for support. A fourth figure stands upright, arms raised, demonstrating his bipedalism. The irony lies in this figure boasting about a simple act like not using hands while standing. This highlights the absurd contrast between fundamental evolutionary milestones and trivial human boasts.",
