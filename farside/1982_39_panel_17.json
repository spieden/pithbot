  "description": "Three figures in Old West attire are engaged in a heated card game. One figure aims a revolver at another, accusing him of cheating during the high-stakes game. The accusation details the act of slipping a card from a sleeve. The absurdity peaks when the accused cheater's final action before being called out was yelling \"Fish!\". This juxtaposition of serious accusation, potential violence, and a childish game name creates a striking moment of incongruity.",
