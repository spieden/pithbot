  "description": "Two large dragons stand over a defeated knight clad in detailed armor, near a cave entrance and a rocky cliff face. One dragon remarks on its culinary habits regarding the knight, specifically stating it avoids consuming the protective metal exterior. This creates dark humor and irony by treating the knight's armor as mere food packaging. The scene presents an absurd scenario where dragons have sophisticated dining preferences for human prey. The specific mention of not eating the 'shells' underscores the surreal anthropomorphism of the mythical creatures.",
