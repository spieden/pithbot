  "description": "This scene depicts the surreal integration of exotic wildlife into a mundane suburban setting, highlighted by a moving truck and a white picket fence. A couple with suitcases are moving in, bringing a large rhino with them, which is walking up a ramp into the truck. A woman in her yard, next to her own massive rhino, observes the newcomers. The absurdity lies in both families owning these powerful wild animals as pets, treating them as casually as dogs or cats. The irony is the neighborly reaction to the arrival of another rhino, rather than surprise at the initial presence of one next door.",
