  "description": "Two fish in a fishbowl are discussing the fate of a third fish who apparently escaped by jumping out of the bowl. One fish observes that it has been more than a week since the escape. On the floor next to the fishbowl stand is a fish skeleton, implying the escape was fatal. The irony lies in the fish's assumption that the skeleton on the floor indicates the escapee \"made it,\" when it clearly signifies death outside of the water. The situation presents a dark, absurd humor where the fish misinterpret the outcome of escaping their limited environment.",
