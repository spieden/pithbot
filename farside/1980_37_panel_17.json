  "description": "In a surreal park setting, a rooster, inexplicably dressed in a suit jacket and hat, strides purposefully while holding a sign. The rooster's human-like action of declaring the wishing well 'out of order' injects an element of absurdism, as animals are typically not concerned with public utilities or maintenance. This juxtaposition of a barnyard animal performing a bureaucratic task creates an ironic situation where even magical services like a wishing well are subject to mundane issues like disrepair. The visual incongruity of the dapper rooster acting as a sort of well attendant underscores the panel's nonsensical humor. It presents a world where the natural order is subtly but pointedly disrupted.",
