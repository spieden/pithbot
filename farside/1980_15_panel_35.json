  "description": "Two large, anthropomorphic fish are seated on a couch in a living room setting. One fish, wearing glasses and a tie, smokes a pipe and addresses a tiny human woman who is walking towards them holding a cup. A large potted plant stands nearby, and a square clock with Roman numerals hangs on the wall. The scene presents an absurd reversal of typical scale and social dynamics, where the fish occupy the dominant, human-like roles in a domestic environment, treating the human as a diminutive, perhaps servile, figure.",
