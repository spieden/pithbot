  "description": "An adult is buried up to their neck in sand on a beach as the tide begins to approach. A child sits nearby with a shovel and bucket, seemingly responsible for the burial but showing no urgency. The buried individual calmly warns the child that the tide is coming in and requests to be dug out, adding a passive-aggressive note about not wanting to get angry. The scene presents an absurd predicament where the vulnerable adult relies on the indifferent child, highlighting a humorous power dynamic and the potential danger of the rising water.",
