  "description": "In a desolate desert landscape marked by a single saguaro, a dealership named \"Camelot\" offers \"New & Used\" camels for sale. A line of camels are displayed as if they were vehicles on a car lot, complete with festive flags. A lone figure lounges outside the structure, evoking the image of a relaxed salesman. The scene presents an absurd and ironic twist on the legendary court of King Arthur, reimagining it as a peculiar commercial enterprise.",
