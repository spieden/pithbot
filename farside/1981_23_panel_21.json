  "description": "A group of figures in hooded robes, typically associated with death, are depicted mingling at a social gathering. They engage in commonplace activities like smoking cigarettes, drinking from bottles and glasses, and serving punch from a bowl. One figure prominently displays a cutout smiley face within their hood, adding a surreal contrast to their grim appearance. The scene presents an absurd juxtaposition of the personification of death with mundane social interaction. The conversation between attendees further highlights this irony, treating the state of death as a personal experience or condition.",
