  "description": "At a social gathering, a woman named Sylvia is seen interacting with a vampire guest. Other attendees observe and comment on Sylvia's choice of romantic partner. The humor arises from the ironic double meaning of calling the vampire a \"fly-by-night boyfriend,\" referencing both his literal nocturnal nature and the colloquialism for an unreliable or temporary romantic partner. The scene juxtaposes the supernatural presence of a vampire with a mundane observation about dating habits.",
