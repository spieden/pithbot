  "description": "This image presents an absurd twist on the traditional stork delivering a baby motif. Instead of a swaddled infant, the stork carries a giant, lit cigarette in its beak, treated with the same care as a precious delivery. This surreal image subverts expectations, highlighting the bizarre reality of addiction or perhaps commenting on the harmful nature of what is being delivered. The juxtaposition of the natural symbol of birth with an unnatural, harmful object creates a darkly humorous and ironic scene.",
