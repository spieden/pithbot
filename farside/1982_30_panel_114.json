  "description": "On a beach, two minimalist stick-figure individuals relaxing on a towel are interrupted by the sudden appearance of a vast, hyper-detailed man in a speedo. As the large man walks past, his foot kicks up a shower of sand, directly hitting one of the stick figures and knocking off their top hat. The stick figures react with distress and annoyance to this intrusion. The humor arises from the stick figures' perception, expressed in the caption, that this physically imposing and realistically drawn figure is a \"real person,\" implying they themselves are not. This highlights an absurd inversion of reality within the visual medium, where the more detailed and conventional depiction is labeled as \"real\" by the simplified characters.",
