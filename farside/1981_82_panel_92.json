  "description": "A group of bison are depicted standing together, several with numerous arrows protruding from their bodies. One bison in the foreground looks towards another while speaking. The absurdity lies in the bison's mundane observation about a 'swarm of horseflies' when clearly they are being attacked with arrows, creating dark irony through their denial or misinterpretation of the dire situation. This highlights the surreal nature of the scene where a common annoyance is mistaken for a lethal threat, underscoring a theme of oblivious suffering.",
