  "description": "Two elderly women are confronted by the Angel of Death attempting to enter their home. The Angel of Death is depicted as a shadowy figure with glowing red eyes, held back by a simple door chain. The women question the supernatural entity's identity, demanding proof that it is the 'real' Angel of Death. This scenario highlights the absurdity of applying mundane skepticism and security measures to a figure of ultimate cosmic certainty. The interaction creates irony by portraying death not as inevitable, but as a potentially fraudulent visitor requiring verification.",
