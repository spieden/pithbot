  "description": "A man in a loincloth stands outside a primitive hut with a woman in a dress and heels. A gorilla face is visible through a window in the hut. The man is apparently introducing the woman to his family, warning her about their unusual habits. The situation presents a surreal juxtaposition of human social interaction with a family of apes. It highlights the absurdity of trying to apply conventional etiquette to such a wild domestic setting.",
