  "description": "An angel with sunglasses and sandals sits on a cloud, playing a harp amplified by a large speaker, creating an absurd juxtaposition of traditional heavenly imagery with elements of rock music. The scene presents a surreal take on the afterlife, suggesting even celestial beings might prefer amplified sound to ethereal melodies. The presence of the large amplifier and electric cord next to the harp is a particularly novel and distinguishing situation.",
