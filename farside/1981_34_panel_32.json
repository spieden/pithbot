  "description": "Two primitive figures stand amidst the wreckage of a large, thick circular object, raising their fists in triumph. One figure is stout and hairy, the other more rounded with an elongated head, and both wear simple loincloths. The broken object, resembling an early wheel, lies in two pieces, one upright and one on the ground, surrounded by small fragments. The scene depicts an absurd moment where early beings seem to have destroyed a potentially revolutionary invention, celebrating its demolition rather than its creation or use.",
