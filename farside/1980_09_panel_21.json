  "description": "A large bull stands poised near the entrance to a bullfighting arena, looking out at a matador and a distant crowd. Several other bulls are visible behind a wooden fence, seemingly watching the scene unfolding. The perspective places the viewer within the bulls' environment, suggesting their observation of the human activity. This setup implies a reversal of roles, positioning the animals as spectators or judges of the performance. The scenario satirizes the ritualistic aspects of the event by giving agency and commentary to the bulls.",
