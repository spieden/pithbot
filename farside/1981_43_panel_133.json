  "description": "The scene depicts three cows standing at a feeding trough filled with hay, engaging in unexpected human-like behavior. One cow is blowing a large, bright pink bubble gum bubble, contrasting with the mundane farm environment. Another cow displays a surreal tail shaped like a dinner fork, adding to the visual absurdity. The combination of anthropomorphic actions and bizarre physical traits subverts expectations of typical farm animals.",
