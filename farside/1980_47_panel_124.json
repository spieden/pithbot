  "description": "Two visitors observe a portrait in a formal setting marked by a rope barrier. The subject of the painting, a man in a tuxedo, is distinguished by his unusually large, prominent nose. The visitors find the portrait unsettling because the nose appears to track their movement across the room. This observation plays on the familiar phenomenon of eyes in a portrait seemingly following the viewer. The humor arises from the absurd focus on the nose rather than the eyes, creating an eerie effect.",
