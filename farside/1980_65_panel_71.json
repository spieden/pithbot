  "description": "A large, muscular, furry creature with prominent claws lies on a therapist's couch in a room illuminated by moonlight streaming through a window. A therapist sits beside the couch, taking notes on a pad. The scene presents an ironic twist on transformation narratives, as the creature is distressed not by its monstrous form but by a curse that turns it into a weak human by day. This absurd situation places a fantastical being in a mundane setting, seeking help for a highly unusual psychological issue.",
