  "description": "A man crashes cymbals loudly while auditioning in an office setting. Another man sits at a desk covering his ears, indicating the overwhelming nature of the event, while a sign directs people to the audition area. Outside the door, another person waits with cymbals, ready for their turn. This depicts a surreal bureaucratic process for evaluating the ability to make noise, highlighting the absurdity of formal selection for such a task.",
