  "description": "Two women relax in armchairs within an all-glass house, one knitting while the other sips tea and displays a distinctive tall, pointy red hairstyle. They acknowledge the inherent disadvantages of living in a completely transparent structure. The comic's dark humor lies in their casual acceptance of this lack of privacy, which is overshadowed by their stated enjoyment of watching birds violently collide with the unseen barrier. This highlights a peculiar form of amusement derived from the absurd environment and its harsh effects on wildlife. The unique all-glass dwelling serves as the central element enabling this ironic and somewhat cruel perspective.",
