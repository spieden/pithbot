  "description": "The image depicts a snake perched atop a rocky peak under a full moon and starry night sky. The snake is emitting an extraordinarily long and visible 'hiss' that trails across the air like a ribbon. This surreal visualization of an animal sound as a tangible form introduces an element of absurdism. The contrast between the natural environment and the bizarre physical manifestation of the sound creates a novel situation. The focus is on exaggerating a simple auditory event into a significant, almost mystical visual phenomenon.",
