  "description": "A monstrous figure operates a stretching device on a bound victim, a surreal scene depicting torture. Knives are stuck into the board around the struggling man, emphasizing the extreme nature of the situation. The absurdity is highlighted by the torturer's casual dialogue in contrast to the horrific act. The irony rests in the threat of escalation from the already brutal 'nice guy' approach. This novel torture scenario combines physical torment with a twisted sense of politeness.",
