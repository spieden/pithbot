  "description": "Two snakes are on a stage with a grassy backdrop, facing an audience of seated snakes in theater seats. One snake dramatically declares, \"I'll come back to you, Sidney!...But I won't crawl!\" This statement is absurd and ironic because crawling is the natural form of locomotion for snakes. The image presents a surreal scenario where snakes participate in a human-like theatrical performance and audience.",
