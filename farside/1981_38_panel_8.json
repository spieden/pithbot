  "description": "An automobile is submerged in water, with only its roof and antenna above the surface. Two elderly occupants are inside; the passenger is reading a manual. The manual offers advice on getting a car unstuck by rocking it back and forth. This presents an absurd scenario where conventional roadside assistance tips are applied to a vehicle floating or sunk in deep water. The image highlights the surreal disconnect between the domestic act of consulting a guide and the extreme, inappropriate environment.",
