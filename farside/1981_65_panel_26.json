  "description": "Two large, anthropomorphic birds stand in a doorway. One bird, wearing a hat, looks out into a starry night, while the other, adorned with glasses and a pearl necklace, stands critically with crossed arms. This surreal scene depicts a domestic confrontation, where one bird's late-night activity is being questioned by its partner. The situation presents an absurd take on typical human relationship dynamics transposed onto avian figures. The specific image of a bird dressed in human attire and jewelry highlights the panel's unique blend of the familiar and the bizarre.",
