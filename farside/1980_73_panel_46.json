  "description": "In a bedroom scene at night, an elderly woman looks on with exasperation as a monstrous, wolf-like creature wearing polka-dot pajamas, a small Santa hat, glasses, and holding a cane climbs out of their shared bed. The full moon is visible outside the window, suggesting a transformation has occurred. The scene finds dark humor in treating the werewolf's nightly transformation not as a horror but as an irritating \"curse\" the partner has simply had enough of, domesticating a typically terrifying concept into a mundane marital complaint.",
