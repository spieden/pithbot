  "description": "In a scene near Gettysburg in 1863, several military figures in Union uniforms stand and sit near a tent during a moment of reflection. One of the seated generals, otherwise appearing conventional, is depicted with prominent rabbit ears extending from his head. This surreal detail injects an element of the absurd into the historical setting of the American Civil War. The presence of animal features on a human military leader creates an unexpected juxtaposition, highlighting the bizarre within a serious context.",
