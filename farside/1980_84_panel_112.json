  "description": "Two anthropomorphized beavers sit on a freshly cut log, observing a burly lumberjack approaching with a chainsaw. The beavers, natural woodcutters, regard the mechanical saw with fear, referring to it by a descriptive, intimidating name, \"the thundertooth.\" This highlights the absurd juxtaposition of animal labor and human technology. The scene presents an ironic power dynamic where the usually industrious beavers are vulnerable to this unnatural, powerful tool.",
