  "description": "Two primitive men, armed with spears, sit on steps before a colossal, spiky stone idol with an angry face. They are discussing the frequency of ritual sacrifices as if it were a burdensome job. The conversation highlights the absurd juxtaposition of ancient, brutal practices with the mundane modern concept of weekend relief. The irony lies in applying the familiar sentiment of gratitude for Friday to the context of religious appeasement through death. This surreal scene treats a sacred or terrifying act as a tedious obligation, emphasizing the banality of extreme circumstances when viewed through a modern lens.",
