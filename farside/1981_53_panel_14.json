  "description": "A mailman stands at a gate talking to a resident, attempting to deliver a massive wooden horse on wheels that looms behind him. The surreal scale of the object, resembling a Trojan horse, is juxtaposed with the mundane setting of a suburban street and a routine delivery interaction. The irony lies in the mailman having the wrong address for this extraordinarily large item. The absurdity is heightened by the recipient seemingly expecting such a delivery, just at a different 'big place'. This highlights the comical disruption of everyday life by the unexpected and the misplaced.",
