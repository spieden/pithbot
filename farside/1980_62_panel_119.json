  "description": "A grandmother casually asks her grandson to retrieve his grandfather, who has been inexplicably 'gotten' by squirrels and is stuck in a tree outside. The scene presents an absurd situation where wild animals have subdued a human, treated with mundane indifference by the family inside their home. This highlights the surreal juxtaposition of domestic normalcy with bizarre, external chaos. The grandfather's predicament, trapped in a tree and harassed by small rodents, is presented as a routine occurrence, adding to the dark humor and absurdity.",
