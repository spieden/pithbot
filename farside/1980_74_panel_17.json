  "description": "A person brings a cane topped with a snake's head into a veterinary clinic. The seated figure, presumably the vet, is diagnosing the snake-headed cane with \"lockbody.\" The instruction to keep the cane calm highlights the absurd treatment of an inanimate object as a living creature. This surreal scenario satirizes the intensity of pet care by applying a medical context to a non-living item.",
