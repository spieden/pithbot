  "description": "A couple approaches a massive, ancient tree in a forest. This tree features a prominent, expressive face formed by its bark and a large hollow mouth. The couple carries a knife, presumably to carve their initials into the trunk. The sentient tree speaks, expressing a hostile awareness of their romantic intention. This situation presents an absurd and ironic reversal of the typical passive tree and active carvers dynamic.",
