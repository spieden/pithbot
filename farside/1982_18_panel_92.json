  "description": "A man floats slightly above his chair, pulling on his vest in agitation while a lit cigar falls from his hand. He is reacting violently to being told he doesn't exist. Another man stands nearby, seemingly delivering the message from the floating individual in this living room setting. The situation presents an absurd scenario where a physical being is confronted with the denial of his own reality. This explores the surreal interplay between perception and existence.",
