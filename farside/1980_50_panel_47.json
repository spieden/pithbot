  "description": "A pilot in classic aviator attire stands proudly beside his vintage airplane on an airfield. The aircraft's fuselage is marked with an unusual tally of targets. Instead of enemy planes, the silhouettes depict cows and a building. The pilot, holding a paint brush, appears ready to add another mark to his peculiar score. This scene presents an absurd application of aerial combat traditions to agricultural subjects.",
