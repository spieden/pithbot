  "description": "Three figures, known for their association with the American frontier and large animals\n\n\n\u2014 Buffalo Bill, Grizzly Adams, and the incongruously named Pigeon Jones\n\n\n\u2014 are depicted sitting around a table with rifles, having a quiet drink. The scene presents an absurd contrast between their rugged, legendary personas and the mundane, domestic setting. The presence of rifles in this context heightens the surreal juxtaposition of wilderness figures in a social, tea-party-like scenario. This gathering of iconic, yet disparate, figures around a table suggests an unexpected and humorous camaraderie outside their usual solitary or adventurous narratives.",
