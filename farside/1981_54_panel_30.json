  "description": "Within a fishbowl, one fish wearing glasses sternly addresses a smaller fish. The larger fish reprimands the smaller one, named Malcolm, for the act of floating belly-up, a behavior typically indicative of death, treating it as a disciplinary issue. This creates a darkly ironic and absurd scenario where mortality is framed as a punishable offense in the context of pet ownership and aquatic life.",
