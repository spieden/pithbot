  "description": "A dog is engaged in a game of fetch with disembodied hands emerging from a rock wall, which repeatedly throw a bone for the dog to retrieve. The dog eagerly fetches the bone, unaware of the unusual source. Later, a caveman walks past the same spot, glancing back, perhaps witnessing the bizarre activity or simply passing by the peculiar rock formation.",
