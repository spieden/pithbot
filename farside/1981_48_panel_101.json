  "description": "Under a full moon and starry sky, a smaller dog wearing a trench coat and hat hurries away from a tipped-over trash can on a sidewalk. The trash can has spilled its contents, including several small, can-shaped objects. A larger dog stands on the steps of a nearby house, pointing an accusing finger at the smaller dog. This scene depicts a moment of domestic confrontation, rendered absurd by the human-like attire and actions of the animals involved in a dispute over garbage.",
