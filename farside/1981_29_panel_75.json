  "description": "The scene presents an absurd juxtaposition of living animals and taxidermy, implying a surreal reversal of roles or perhaps an ironic self-improvement class. An ostrich and a standing bear observe a woman with curlers who holds stuffed logs, while a porcupine lies on the floor near a book titled \"Taxidermy at Home.\" The presence of stuffed heads of a buffalo, giraffe, and bear on the wall further emphasizes the theme of preserved animal forms. This creates a darkly humorous and unsettling environment where the boundaries between life and death, student and subject, are blurred.",
