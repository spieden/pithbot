  "description": "A bearded man and a woman with bushy hair are in an inflatable raft on calm water, with land visible in the background. The woman holds a large conch shell to the man's ear, suggesting he can hear the ocean, despite their location far from the sea. This presents an ironic contrast between the common belief about conch shells and the actual environment they inhabit.  The situation highlights the absurdity of seeking a sound associated with a distant place through a symbolic object while situated somewhere else entirely.",
