  "description": "In a prehistoric landscape featuring mammoths and rocky outcrops, a caveman operates a service stand constructed from straw and palm trees. Above the counter, a sign proudly proclaims 'OVER 3 SERVED'. This absurd scene juxtaposes modern business metrics and marketing boasts with a primitive era, highlighting the irony of celebrating such a minimal customer count in a time focused on basic survival. The straw hut resembling a contemporary food stand adds to the surreal blending of different time periods.",
