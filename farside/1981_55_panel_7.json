  "description": "A caveman examines the fossilized remains of a car in a field littered with small dark objects. An elephant stands behind him on a small incline, near a rocky hill with a cave entrance. The scene juxtaposes prehistoric life with a relic of modern technology presented as an ancient artifact. This creates an absurd situation where a primitive human studies a fossilized car. The imagery suggests a bizarre timeline where technology is ancient history.",
