  "description": "A large, dark submarine is depicted underwater. It has deployed a fishing rod from its top, with the line and lure cast towards the submarine's own spinning propeller at the bow, which is generating bubbles. This portrays an absurd scenario where a sophisticated vessel is engaging in a nonsensical act. The image highlights the surreal contrast between complex machinery and a simple, misguided task, perhaps attempting to catch something tangled in its propeller or simply 'fishing' its own wake.",
