  "description": "A giant stork carries a swaddled baby towards a house. Two excited stick-figure children stand on the doorstep with open arms, apparently waiting to receive the infant directly from the bird. This surreal scenario bypasses adult involvement in the delivery process, placing the responsibility or role of welcoming the new family member solely on the children. The scene is observed by a small dog near the house.",
