  "description": "The totem pole carvings in the first panel are depicted as sentient beings making bizarre, animated expressions and movements, such as sticking out a tongue and shaking. This absurd sight elicits bewildered reactions from the two seated figures below. In stark contrast, the second panel shows the same totem pole carvings in their usual static, carved state, prompting the seated figures to display serene approval. The surreal animation of the totem pole figures highlights a humorous subversion of expectations regarding traditional cultural artifacts. The changing demeanor of the seated figures based on the totem pole's state provides the central irony.",
